There are three main types:\n   - **Divergent Boundaries**: Where plates move apart, such as at mid-ocean ridges. As the plates separate, magma rises from the mantle to fill the gap, solidifying to form new oceanic crust and creating volcanic activity.\n   - **Convergent Boundaries**: Where plates collide. When an oceanic plate subducts (dives beneath) a continental or another oceanic plate, the descending plate melts due to high pressure and temperature. The resulting magma is less dense than the surrounding rock and rises, forming volcanoes. This often creates volcanic arcs, like the Andes or the Japanese islands.\n   - **Transform Boundaries**: Where plates slide past each other. While these typically don't produce volcanoes, some transform zones can have volcanic activity due to associated fractures and magma movement.\n\n2. **Hotspots**: Some volcanoes form away from plate boundaries, over \"hotspots\"—areas where plumes of hot mantle"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "llm_as_judge_eval": 0.0, "input": "Please listen to the audio and provide your response."}

He observed that the Earth's shadow during lunar eclipses is always round, which would only be possible if the Earth were spherical. He also noted that stars visible in the southern sky disappear gradually as one travels north, suggesting a curved surface.\n\nLater, around 240 BCE, the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes made a remarkably accurate calculation of the Earth's circumference by measuring the angle of the Sun's rays at two different locations—Syene and Alexandria—on the summer solstice. His results were remarkably close to modern measurements, providing strong empirical support for a spherical Earth.\n\nAs for why people initially believed the Earth was flat, this was largely due to limited observational tools and the immediate sensory experience of the Earth's surface. From a human perspective, the ground appears flat, and the horizon seems level. In many early cultures, flat Earth models were consistent with religious or mythological cosmologies.

Suetonius wrote *The Twelve Caesars* during the early 2nd century AD, most likely around 121 AD, during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117–138 AD). This was a period of relative peace and stability in the Roman Empire, known as the *Pax Romana*, and Hadrian was known for his interest in Roman history, culture, and the legacy of past emperors.\n\nSuetonius was a Roman historian and biographer who served as a secretary to Emperor Hadrian, which gave him access to imperial archives and firsthand knowledge of court life. His work on the Twelve Caesars—covering Julius Caesar and the first eleven Roman emperors from Augustus to Domitian—was part of a broader biographical project. The book is notable for its blend of factual detail and anecdotal, sometimes scandalous, stories, reflecting both historical record and popular rumor.\n\nThe timing of the work is significant: Domitian, the last emperor covered in the book, had been assassinated in 96 AD, and the Flavian dynasty had ended.

His early life was marked by modest means, and he developed an interest in drawing and art from a young age.\n\nDisney began his career in the early 1920s in the fledgling animation industry. In 1923, he co-founded the Disney Brothers Studio (later The Walt Disney Company) with his older brother Roy O. Disney in Los Angeles. Their first successful animated series was \"Alice Comedies,\" which combined live-action and animation. However, it was the creation of the character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit that brought them initial success.\n\nIn 1928, Walt Disney introduced Mickey Mouse in the short film \"Steamboat Willie,\" which was the first synchronized sound cartoon and a massive hit. Mickey Mouse quickly became a cultural icon and the face of the Disney studio.

However, it wasn't until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that these principles were applied practically.\n\nIn the 1800s, pioneers like Otto Lilienthal conducted experiments with gliders, studying how wings could generate lift. His work inspired many others, including the Wright brothers—Orville and Wilbur Wright from Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe Wright brothers conducted extensive research and testing. They built a wind tunnel to study airfoils and designed a three-axis control system that allowed pilots to steer the aircraft effectively. On December 17, 1903, they achieved the first powered, controlled, and sustained flight of an airplane—the Wright Flyer—at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

This ensures even cooking.\n\n3. **Pat Dry**: Use paper towels to dry the steak thoroughly. Moisture is the enemy of a good sear.\n\n4. **Season Generously**: Salt and pepper are your best friends. Season both sides just before cooking. For extra flavor, add garlic, herbs, or a spice rub.\n\n5. **Preheat Your Pan or Grill**: Use a heavy skillet (cast iron is ideal) or grill over high heat. It should be smoking hot—this creates a perfect crust.\n\n6. **Sear First**: Sear the steak for 2–3 minutes per side without moving it.

Quantum computing is a revolutionary approach to computation that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways fundamentally different from classical computers.\n\nHere are the basics:\n\n1. **Qubits (Quantum Bits)**:  \n   The fundamental unit of information in a quantum computer is the qubit. Unlike classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This means a single qubit can represent multiple states at once, enabling parallel computation.\n\n2. **Superposition**:  \n   Superposition allows a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time. For example, a system of two qubits can be in a superposition of all four possible states: 00, 01, 10, and 11. This exponential growth in state space is what gives quantum computers their potential power.\n\n3. **Entanglement**:  \n   Entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more qubits become linked in such a way that the state of one qubit instantly influences the state of another, no matter the distance between them.

You can also check the menu—restaurants popular with locals often feature traditional, regional dishes at reasonable prices, while tourist-oriented spots may offer simplified or \"exoticized\" versions of food with higher prices. Additionally, look at the restaurant's location; places in tourist-heavy areas like city centers or near attractions often target visitors, whereas those in residential neighborhoods or side streets are more likely frequented by locals.

Does it include only commercially released music? What about amateur recordings, home demos, or traditional folk songs passed down orally?
