Tom Wilson is a real person — he is a professional ice hockey player, currently playing in the NHL.\n4. Ice hockey does not have penalty kicks. Instead, it has penalty shots, which are different.\n5. Penalty kicks are specific to soccer, not ice hockey.\n6. Therefore, if Tom Wilson is the ice hockey player, it is implausible that he scored a penalty kick in a hockey context.\n7.
