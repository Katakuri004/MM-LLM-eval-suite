It plays a central role in cellular metabolism and energy production. Here's what NAD does for the cell:\n\n1. **Energy Production**: NAD is essential in cellular respiration, particularly in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. It acts as an electron carrier, accepting electrons during metabolic reactions and becoming reduced to NADH. This NADH then donates electrons to the electron transport chain, ultimately driving ATP synthesis—the cell's primary energy currency.\n\n2. **Redox Reactions**: NAD shuttles electrons between reactions, facilitating oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. It cycles between its oxidized form (NAD⁺) and reduced form (NADH), enabling the transfer of energy and electrons within the cell.\n\n3. **Cellular Signaling and Regulation**: NAD is a substrate for several important enzymes involved in cellular signaling and regulation, including:\n   - **Sirtuins**: A family of NAD-dependent deacetylases that regulate gene expression, DNA repair, and aging.\n   - **PARPs (Poly(ADP-ri"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "pedant_score": 0.0, "gpt4_score": 0.0, "input": "Please listen to the audio and provide your response."}
