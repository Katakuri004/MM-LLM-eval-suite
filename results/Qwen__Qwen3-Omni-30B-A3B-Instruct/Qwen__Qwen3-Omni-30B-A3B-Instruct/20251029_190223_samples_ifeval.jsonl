He was the son of Pons Count of Tripoli and Hodierna of Jerusalem. Raymond inherited the County of Tripoli in 1152 after the death of his father. At the time of his succession Raymond was still a minor and his mother Hodierna acted as regent until he came of age. The County of Tripoli was one of the four major Crusader states established after the First Crusade and was strategically located along the eastern Mediterranean coast. Raymond's rule was marked by both internal and external challenges as he navigated the complex politics of the Crusader states and relations with neighboring Muslim powers.\n\n*highlighted section part 2* **Political Intrigues and Alliances**  \nRaymond III was deeply involved in the political struggles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. He was a key figure during the reign of King Baldwin III and later during the minority of Baldwin IV who suffered from leprosy. Raymond was a member of the powerful Haute Cour the high court of Jerusalem and often clashed with other nobles such as the Ibelin family and the regent Raymond of Tripoli. He was also involved in the power struggle between the royal house and the nobility. Raymond supported the claim of Sibylla to the throne and later backed her marriage to Guy of Lusignan which caused significant controversy.

After the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 he retreated to Tripoli and continued to resist Muslim advances. Raymond died in 1187 and was succeeded by his nephew Bohemond III.

But hammocks aren’t just for relaxation—they’re also an excellent choice for sleep. Whether you're a seasoned camper or someone who simply wants to improve their rest, sleeping in a hammock offers a range of surprising benefits that go far beyond comfort.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of hammock sleeping is its ability to support your spine. Unlike traditional beds, which can create pressure points and misalign your spine, a properly suspended hammock cradles your body in a natural, neutral position. The gentle curve of the hammock distributes your weight evenly, reducing strain on your back, neck, and hips. This can lead to fewer aches and pains upon waking and may even help alleviate chronic back issues over time.\n\nAnother major benefit is improved sleep quality. Because hammocks move with your body, they reduce tossing and turning. This constant, gentle motion can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. Many people report feeling more deeply rested after sleeping in a hammock, even during short naps. The rhythmic swaying mimics the motion of being rocked as a baby, which can be incredibly soothing and conducive to relaxation.\n\nHammocks also offer excellent ventilation. Since they’re suspended off the ground, air circulates freely around your body, keeping you cool in warm weather and preventing overheating. This is especially helpful for people who tend to sleep hot or live in humid climates. In contrast, traditional beds can trap heat and moisture, leading to discomfort and disrupted sleep.\n\nFor outdoor enthusiasts, hammock camping is a game-changer. It’s lightweight, portable, and allows you to sleep above the ground, keeping you safe from insects, moisture, and uneven terrain. You can set up a hammock almost anywhere—under trees, in a backyard, or even in a park—making it a flexible and accessible option for anyone who loves the outdoors.\n\nEven if you’re not a camper, you can enjoy the benefits of a hammock indoors. Many people use them as cozy reading nooks or nap stations. With the right setup, a hammock can become a stylish and functional addition to your home, offering a unique way to unwind and recharge.\n\nIn conclusion, sleeping in a hammock isn’t just a novelty—it’s a smart, health-conscious choice that promotes better posture, deeper sleep, and overall comfort. Whether you're looking to improve your sleep, enjoy the outdoors, or simply try something new, a hammock might just be the upgrade your rest needs. So why not give it a try? You might just find your best night’s sleep yet."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a blog post with 400 or more words about the benefits of sleeping in a hammock."}

The morning light streamed through the window in a way that felt scripted, casting shadows that aligned with impossible precision. He blinked, expecting the usual imperfections: the chipped paint on the wall, the faint hum of the refrigerator. But everything was flawless, like a render from a high-end game. Then he noticed the floating text above his coffee mug: \"Morning Brew (x3)\" with a tiny icon of a steaming cup. His heart stuttered. He tried to move his hand, but the motion felt delayed, as if controlled by invisible inputs. He looked down and saw a translucent HUD overlaying his vision—health bar, stamina, and a mini-map pulsing in the corner. He wasn't just in a game. He was a character.\n\n***\nPanicked, Thomas sprinted to the mirror and froze. His reflection was glitching—pixels flickering at the edges, his face momentarily replaced by a placeholder model labeled \"Player Avatar v1.0.\" He tried to scream, but the sound was muffled, replaced by a soft \"System Alert: Emotional Outburst Detected.\" A voice boomed from nowhere: \"Welcome to *Elysium Online*, Player 7742.

Please proceed to the town square for your first quest.\" He stumbled outside, where townspeople moved in perfect loops, their dialogue repeating like pre-recorded lines.

The Tang emperors were known for their strong leadership and their ability to maintain peace across vast territories. However, this peace was often tested by war, both internal and external.\n\nWar was a constant threat during the early years of the Tang dynasty. The dynasty itself came to power after a war that ended the Sui dynasty. This war was followed by a period of peace as the Tang consolidated their rule. Yet, war soon broke out again as the Tang faced rebellions and invasions. The An Lushan Rebellion, a devastating war that lasted from 755 to 763, nearly destroyed the Tang. This war caused widespread suffering and weakened the central government, but eventually peace was restored.\n\nDespite the war-torn years, the Tang dynasty managed to maintain peace in many regions through diplomacy and military strength. The Tang army was one of the most powerful in the world, and its presence deterred war from breaking out in many areas. The Silk Road flourished during this time, bringing peace through trade and cultural exchange. However, war was never far away, especially along the northern borders where the Tang fought against the Turks and other nomadic tribes.\n\nPeace was a major goal of Tang rulers, who believed that a peaceful empire would lead to prosperity. They established a civil service system that promoted peace through education and merit. Yet, war often disrupted this peace. The Tang faced war with Tibet, Vietnam, and other neighboring states. Each war required careful planning and resources, but the Tang usually managed to restore peace after victory.\n\nThe Tang dynasty also experienced internal war, such as the war between rival factions within the imperial court. These wars weakened the dynasty over time. However, even during these internal wars, the Tang maintained peace in the countryside through local governance. The people often preferred peace over the chaos of war, and this desire for peace helped sustain the dynasty for centuries.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tang dynasty was a time of both war and peace. War shaped its history, but peace was the ideal that guided its rulers. The Tang emperors used war to defend their borders and peace to build a great civilization. Even in the face of war, they sought peace.

Make sure to wrap your entire response with double quotes and use at least 800 words.", {"until": [], "do_sample": false, "temperature": 0.0, "max_new_tokens": 1280}, 37, "ifeval", "train"], "filtered_resps": ["\"By the end of the 19th century, the sentiments of the Croatian and Serbian nations toward the Austrian Empire were complex, shaped by historical experiences, national aspirations, and the evolving political landscape of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. While both Croats and Serbs were subjects of the Habsburg Empire, their relationship with Vienna and Budapest was markedly different due to distinct historical trajectories, religious affiliations, and political ambitions. These differences led to divergent attitudes toward the Empire, ranging from cautious cooperation to open resistance, and from cultural preservation to active nationalism.\n\nCroatia, as a historical kingdom, had long-standing ties with the Habsburgs, dating back to the 16th century when it became part of the Habsburg Monarchy following the Ottoman conquests in the Balkans. By the 19th century, Croatia was formally part of the Kingdom of Hungary within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. This arrangement granted Hungary significant autonomy, but Croatia’s autonomy was limited and often contested. The Croatian people, predominantly Catholic and ethnically distinct from Hungarians, harbored a deep sense of national identity and historical pride. However, their political status within the Hungarian half of the Empire was a source of frustration. The Croatian nobility and intelligentsia increasingly resented Hungarian dominance, particularly after the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868, which granted Croatia nominal autonomy but placed it under Hungarian jurisdiction in many key areas, including finance and military matters.\n\nCroatian sentiment toward the Austrian Empire was thus ambivalent. On one hand, many Croats viewed the Habsburgs as a counterbalance to Hungarian centralization and a potential protector of Croatian autonomy. The Habsburg Emperor, as the nominal ruler of Croatia, was often seen as a symbol of stability and a possible ally in resisting Hungarian encroachments. On the other hand, the Croatian elite also recognized the limitations of Habsburg support. The Austrian government, preoccupied with maintaining the integrity of the multi-ethnic Empire, often prioritized stability over national aspirations. As a result, Croatian nationalists, such as those associated with the Party of Rights led by Ante Starčević, advocated for greater autonomy or even full independence, criticizing both Hungarian and Austrian authorities for failing to respect Croatian sovereignty.\n\nIn contrast, the Serbian nation’s relationship with the Austrian Empire was more antagonistic. Serbs were primarily concentrated in the southern regions of the Empire, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which had been annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908, and in the Military Frontier, a region historically used by the Habsburgs to defend against the Ottomans. The Serbs in these areas were Orthodox Christians, a religious minority within the predominantly Catholic Empire, and their cultural and national identity was often suppressed or marginalized. The Habsburg authorities, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, implemented policies that favored Catholic and Muslim populations while restricting Serbian cultural and educational institutions. This created widespread resentment among the Serbian population.\n\nSerbian sentiment toward the Austrian Empire was thus largely negative. Many Serbs viewed the Habsburgs as foreign occupiers, especially after the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908, which was met with outrage across the Serbian nation. The annexation was perceived as a violation of Serbian national interests, as Bosnia and Herzegovina had a significant Serbian population, and many Serbs aspired to unite with the Kingdom of Serbia. The Serbian government, under King Peter I and later King Alexander, actively supported Serbian nationalist movements in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the annexation became a catalyst for rising tensions in the Balkans.\n\nDespite this antagonism, some Serbs within the Empire, particularly in the Military Frontier and among the educated elite, maintained a more pragmatic stance. They recognized that the Habsburgs had provided a degree of stability and protection from Ottoman rule, and some even served in the Austro-Hungarian military or civil service. However, these individuals were often seen as collaborators by more radical Serbian nationalists. The Serbian Orthodox Church, a key institution in preserving Serbian identity, also maintained a cautious relationship with the Habsburg authorities, seeking to protect its institutions while resisting assimilation.\n\nThe differing sentiments of Croats and Serbs toward the Austrian Empire were further complicated by the broader context of Balkan nationalism and the decline of the Ottoman Empire. As the Ottoman grip weakened, both Croats and Serbs began to look toward the creation of nation-states that would reflect their ethnic and cultural identities. For Croats, this meant seeking greater autonomy within the Empire or unification with other South Slavs. For Serbs, it meant liberation from foreign rule and the creation of a Greater Serbia. These aspirations were often in conflict with the interests of the Habsburgs, who sought to maintain the status quo and prevent the disintegration of their multi-ethnic empire.\n\nIn conclusion, by the end of the 19th century, Croatian sentiment toward the Austrian Empire was characterized by a mix of loyalty to the Habsburgs as a counterweight to Hungarian dominance and frustration with limited autonomy. Serbian sentiment, on the other hand, was largely hostile, shaped by religious and cultural marginalization and the desire for national liberation. These divergent attitudes reflected the complex interplay of nationalism, religion, and imperial politics in the final decades of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, setting the stage for the upheavals of the early 20th century.\""], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "What sentiments existed in the Croatian and Serbian nations towards the Austrian Empire at the end of the 19th century?

Let’s talk about something we all use every single day—*the internet*. You know, that thing you scroll through on your phone, stream music, play games, and video call your friends with? But have you ever stopped to think about how it all started? Today, we’re diving into the wild history of the internet and how it’s totally changed our lives—especially for teens like us.\n\nSo, where did it all begin? Believe it or not, the internet wasn’t always this fast, flashy, and everywhere. It started back in the 1960s, during the Cold War. The U.S. government wanted a way to keep communication going even if part of the country got hit. So, they created something called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). It was basically a super basic network that connected computers at universities and research labs. The first message sent was just ‘LO’—they tried to send ‘LOGIN’ but the system crashed! Yeah, even the internet had a few stumbles at the beginning.\n\nFast forward to the 1980s and 1990s—this is when things got interesting. Scientists and tech geeks started building the tools we now take for granted. Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, invented the World Wide Web in 1989. That’s the part of the internet we actually *see*—websites, links, and all that cool stuff. Suddenly, sharing information wasn’t just for experts anymore. It was for everyone.\n\nThen came the 2000s—our parents’ teens’ time—and the internet exploded. Dial-up internet was slow and made that annoying screeching noise, but it was revolutionary! Then broadband came along, making everything faster. Social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and later Instagram and TikTok took over our lives. We could share photos, videos, and thoughts with people across the globe in seconds.\n\nNow, here’s the real kicker: the internet has changed how we learn, connect, and even think. Want to learn how to play guitar? YouTube has a tutorial. Need help with math? Khan Academy is just a click away. Want to start a business or share your art? The internet gives you a global audience. It’s like having a superpower in your pocket.\n\nBut it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. The internet can be overwhelming. There’s too much information, fake news, cyberbullying, and screen addiction. It’s easy to get lost in endless scrolling or compare ourselves to others online. That’s why it’s so important to use the internet wisely—set limits, protect your privacy, and remember that real life is just as important.\n\nSo, what’s next? The internet is still growing. We’re seeing things like virtual reality, AI, and even the metaverse. Who knows what teens in the future will be doing online? Maybe we’ll be living in digital worlds or talking to robots. But one thing’s for sure: the internet is a tool, and how we use it shapes our world.\n\nBottom line? The internet is one of the most amazing inventions in history—and we’re living through its evolution. So next time you’re online, take a second to appreciate how far we’ve come. And hey, maybe send a quick ‘LO’ to the internet’s first message. 😉\""], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a blog post about the history of the internet and how it has impacted our lives.

A breath. A sudden grin.  \n\nHe cleared his throat. \"That book,\" he said,  \n\"Is it the one that I once read?  \nThe one about the sea and sand?\"  \nShe blinked. \"You know it?

{"doc_id": 49, "target": "0", "arguments": ["I have a dime. What can I do with this dime? Give me advice in the style of a President of the United States and make sure it has at least 600 words.", {"until": [], "do_sample": false, "temperature": 0.0, "max_new_tokens": 1280}, 49, "ifeval", "train"], "filtered_resps": ["My fellow Americans,\n\nToday, I stand before you not just as your President, but as a fellow citizen of this great nation, one who believes deeply in the power of small beginnings and the dignity of every individual effort. And so, I want to speak to you about something that may seem trivial at first glance—a dime. Yes, a dime. But let us not be fooled by its size or its value. In the hands of a determined and thoughtful American, even a dime can become a symbol of resilience, ingenuity, and hope.\n\nNow, I know what some of you might be thinking: “Mr. President, a dime? That’s hardly enough to make a difference.” But I say to you, my friends, that history has shown us time and again that the smallest actions can spark the greatest changes. Think of the dime that helped a young inventor buy his first tools. Think of the dime that allowed a student to buy a textbook and change the course of their life. Think of the dime that was placed in a donation jar, helping feed a hungry child, or fund a community garden in a food desert.\n\nSo, what can you do with this dime? Let me offer you some advice, not as a politician, but as a fellow human being who believes in the American dream.\n\nFirst, consider giving it away. Not because it’s a grand gesture, but because it’s a statement. A dime given freely to someone in need—whether it’s a homeless person on the street, a struggling single parent, or a child in a food line—sends a message: “You matter. You are seen. You are not alone.” In a world that often feels cold and transactional, that small act of generosity can warm a heart and restore faith in our shared humanity.\n\nSecond, invest it. Yes, I said invest. Not in stocks or real estate—though those are noble pursuits—but in yourself. Use that dime to buy a bus ticket to an interview, a coffee to fuel a job search, or a book that could change your life. That dime could be the seed of a new career, a new skill, or a new dream. Remember, every great journey begins with a single step, and sometimes, that step is paid for with a dime.\n\nThird, use it to start a conversation. Ask someone, “What would you do with a dime?” You’d be surprised how many people have stories to tell. You might learn about someone’s struggle, their hopes, or their quiet acts of courage. In doing so, you build bridges. You foster empathy. You strengthen the very fabric of our democracy.\n\nFourth, save it. Not because it’s a fortune, but because saving teaches discipline. In a nation that values hard work and perseverance, saving even a dime is a form of patriotism. It’s a quiet declaration that you believe in tomorrow. And who knows? That dime might one day grow into a quarter, a dollar, or more. But even if it doesn’t, the habit of saving is a gift you give to your future self.\n\nFifth, use it to support local business. That dime could buy a candy bar from a neighborhood store, a soda from a family-run diner, or a comic book from a small shop. In doing so, you’re not just spending money—you’re investing in your community. You’re helping keep Main Street alive. You’re saying, “I believe in the American dream, and I want to help others live it too.”\n\nAnd finally, let that dime remind you of the power of small things. In a world obsessed with headlines and grand gestures, we often forget that change is made in the quiet moments, in the everyday choices. A dime may not buy you a mansion or a private jet, but it can buy you dignity, compassion, and the chance to make a difference.\n\nSo, my fellow Americans, I urge you: don’t underestimate the value of a dime. Use it wisely. Use it generously. Use it with purpose. Because in the end, it’s not the size of the coin that matters—it’s the size of the heart behind it.\n\nLet us all remember that every American, no matter their station in life, has the power to contribute. And sometimes, that contribution begins with a single dime.\n\nThank you, and may God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "I have a dime.

Have more than 30 sentences in your response.", {"until": [], "do_sample": false, "temperature": 0.0, "max_new_tokens": 1280}, 52, "ifeval", "train"], "filtered_resps": ["Aluminium cans are a common and effective method of storing food, providing a reliable barrier against light, air, and moisture. This makes them ideal for preserving the freshness and nutritional value of many types of food. The material used to make these cans is primarily aluminium, a lightweight and durable metal that is easily recyclable. One of the main advantages of aluminium as a storage material is its ability to prevent spoilage, which helps extend the shelf life of meals. Many canned foods, such as vegetables, fruits, soups, and meats, are stored in aluminium containers to maintain their quality over time. These cans are especially useful for long-term storage, making them a staple in emergency preparedness kits. The meal inside the can remains safe to consume for months or even years, depending on the type of food and storage conditions. \n\nAluminium cans are also popular because they are easy to transport and store. Their compact shape allows for efficient stacking, which is beneficial in both retail and home settings. The material is non-reactive, meaning it does not interact with the food, preserving the original taste and texture. This is particularly important for acidic foods like tomatoes or citrus fruits, which could otherwise react with other metals. The use of aluminium in food storage has become widespread due to its excellent protective qualities. However, despite its benefits, the disposal of aluminium cans raises concerns about waste. When not properly recycled, these cans contribute to environmental pollution. \n\nRecycling aluminium is highly efficient, requiring only about 5% of the energy needed to produce new aluminium from raw materials. This makes aluminium cans a more sustainable option compared to many other packaging materials. Still, the issue of waste remains a challenge, especially in regions with inadequate recycling infrastructure. Many people discard aluminium cans without considering their recyclability, leading to unnecessary waste. To reduce this, governments and organizations have launched campaigns to promote proper disposal and recycling. \n\nIn addition to their environmental impact, aluminium cans also play a role in food safety. The manufacturing process includes strict hygiene standards to ensure that the material does not contaminate the meal inside. Sealed cans prevent bacteria and other pathogens from entering, which is crucial for maintaining food safety. This is especially important for canned meals that are consumed without further cooking. The meal inside is typically pre-cooked and sterilized before being sealed, ensuring it is safe to eat straight from the can. \n\nAluminium cans are also used in the food industry for bulk storage and distribution. Large-scale producers rely on them to ship products across long distances without compromising quality. This is particularly useful for international trade, where food must travel long distances. The durability of the material ensures that the cans can withstand rough handling during transportation. Moreover, the lightweight nature of aluminium reduces shipping costs and fuel consumption, which is beneficial for both businesses and the environment. \n\nDespite their advantages, some people have concerns about the potential health effects of aluminium. While the amount of aluminium that leaches into food is minimal and considered safe by health authorities, some consumers prefer alternatives. Nevertheless, the benefits of aluminium cans in preserving meals and reducing food waste often outweigh these concerns. In fact, by preventing spoilage, aluminium cans help reduce food waste, which is a major global issue. \n\nThe meal inside an aluminium can is often designed to be nutritionally balanced, especially in ready-to-eat meals and military rations. These meals are formulated to provide essential nutrients and energy, making them ideal for people on the go. The convenience of opening a can and consuming a complete meal without preparation is a significant advantage. This is why aluminium cans are popular among campers, hikers, and people with limited access to cooking facilities. \n\nIn conclusion, aluminium cans are a vital part of modern food storage. Their material properties make them effective at preserving meals and protecting them from spoilage. While waste remains a concern, recycling efforts can mitigate this issue. With proper disposal and increased awareness, aluminium cans can continue to serve as a practical and sustainable solution for storing food."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "Write an essay about how aluminium cans are used in food storage.

The first would be to estimate how many hours you have each day for parenting, and whether that time is sufficient to meet your child’s needs. This initial assessment is crucial because it sets the foundation for creating a realistic and sustainable schedule. A well-thought-out schedule not only helps manage responsibilities but also ensures that both parents remain actively involved in their child’s life.\n\nWhen developing a parenting schedule, it's important to consider not just the number of hours available, but also the quality of time spent. For example, a child benefits more from focused, consistent interaction than from scattered, rushed moments. That’s why a clear schedule is so essential—it provides structure and predictability, which are key for a child’s emotional and psychological development.\n\nBegin by listing all your daily commitments, including work, errands, and personal responsibilities. Then, carve out dedicated blocks of time for parenting activities such as school pickups, homework help, extracurriculars, and one-on-one time. This process helps you determine whether your current routine allows for meaningful engagement with your child. If not, adjustments must be made.\n\nA shared parenting schedule should be flexible enough to accommodate changes but firm enough to provide stability. For instance, alternating weekends or dividing weekdays between parents can be effective, depending on your circumstances. The goal is to create a schedule that both parents can follow consistently, minimizing confusion and conflict.\n\nMoreover, involving a neutral helper—such as a family mediator or counselor—can be extremely beneficial. They can guide discussions, help identify potential issues, and assist in crafting a schedule that works for everyone involved. These professionals often bring objectivity and experience that can prevent misunderstandings and promote cooperation.\n\nOnce a schedule is agreed upon, it’s vital to communicate it clearly to all parties. This includes your child, so they understand what to expect. Children thrive on routine, and a consistent schedule helps them feel secure. It also allows you to plan ahead, whether it’s for appointments, travel, or special events.\n\nRegularly reviewing and revising the schedule is another important step. As children grow, their needs change, and so should the parenting plan. Monthly check-ins can help ensure the schedule remains effective and relevant. These reviews also provide an opportunity to address any concerns and make necessary adjustments.\n\nIn conclusion, creating a parenting schedule is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. It requires honesty, cooperation, and a willingness to adapt. By investing time in developing a thoughtful and balanced schedule, parents can ensure their child receives consistent care and attention, while also maintaining their own well-being. A strong schedule is more than just a timetable—it’s a roadmap for a healthy, supportive family dynamic."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "Take the text below as a starting point, and make it a complete article: \"You may have to meet with a helper to work out a parenting plan.

Despite its savory taste and culinary use in savory dishes, it is not an animal and therefore not a fish.\n\nNow, let’s dive into an interesting exploration of both salmon and avocado — two foods that are often found together on plates, but couldn’t be more different in origin.\n\nSalmon is a migratory fish belonging to the family Salmonidae. These fish are known for their incredible life cycle, often traveling thousands of miles from the ocean to freshwater rivers to spawn. There are several species, including Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, and Atlantic salmon. Wild salmon are prized for their rich flavor and high omega-3 fatty acid content, which supports heart and brain health. Salmon farming has grown significantly, though it raises environmental concerns such as pollution and the spread of sea lice.\n\nIn contrast, the avocado is a tropical fruit native to Mexico and Central America. It's technically a berry, with a large seed and creamy flesh. Avocados are packed with healthy monounsaturated fats, fiber, and potassium. They’ve become a staple in modern diets, especially in dishes like guacamole and salads. Despite their popularity, avocado farming has led to deforestation in some regions, highlighting the need for sustainable practices.\n\nInterestingly, both salmon and avocado are considered SUPERFOODS by many nutritionists. They’re rich in nutrients that support overall wellness. Salmon provides high-quality protein and vitamin D, while avocados offer heart-healthy fats and antioxidants.\n\nIn culinary terms, they complement each other beautifully. A grilled salmon fillet topped with avocado salsa is a delicious fusion of textures and flavors. This pairing is not just tasty — it’s a balanced meal combining lean protein and healthy fats.\n\nSo, while both are excellent choices for a nutritious diet, remember: salmon is a fish, and avocado is a fruit. One swims, the other grows on a tree.

Here's a balanced comparison of their pros and cons:\n\n**Pros of Kotlin:**\n\n1. **Concise Syntax**: Kotlin reduces boilerplate code significantly. For example, data classes and property delegation eliminate the need for repetitive getter/setter methods.\n2. **Null Safety**: Kotlin's type system includes nullability by default, reducing the risk of NullPointerExceptions at runtime.\n3. **Interoperability**: Kotlin works seamlessly with Java. It can call Java code and vice versa, making migration easier.\n4. **Modern Features**: Kotlin supports functional programming, extension functions, coroutines for asynchronous programming, and more.\n5. **Tooling Support**: Excellent IDE support (especially in IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio) with features like refactoring and code completion.\n6. **Official Android Language**: Google officially supports Kotlin as a first-class language for Android development.\n\n**Cons of Kotlin:**\n\n1. **Learning Curve**: Developers new to functional programming or modern language features may find Kotlin's syntax and concepts challenging.\n2. **Smaller Ecosystem**: While growing rapidly, Kotlin's ecosystem is still smaller than Java's, especially in non-Android domains.\n3. **Compilation Time**: Kotlin can have longer compilation times compared to Java, especially in large projects.\n4. **Less Mature in Some Areas**: Some libraries and frameworks may lag behind in Kotlin-specific support or documentation.\n\n**Pros of Java:**\n\n1. **Mature Ecosystem**: Java has decades of development, resulting in a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and frameworks (e.g., Spring, Hibernate).\n2. **Widespread Adoption**: Java is used across enterprise applications, Android (historically), web services, and embedded systems.\n3. **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and community resources are available.\n4. **Strong Tooling**: Mature IDEs and debugging tools with deep integration.\n5. **Backward Compatibility**: Java prioritizes backward compatibility, making it easier to maintain legacy code.\n\n**Cons of Java:**\n\n1. **Verbose Syntax**: Java requires more boilerplate code, which can reduce productivity and increase error potential.\n2. **Null Safety**: Java lacks built-in null safety, leading to runtime exceptions if not handled carefully.\n3. **Slower Evolution**: Java has historically been slower to adopt modern programming paradigms compared to Kotlin.\n4. **Limited Functional Features**: While Java 8+ introduced lambdas and streams, it still lacks some functional programming conveniences found in Kotlin.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nKotlin is often preferred for new projects, especially in Android development, due to its modern features and concise syntax. Java remains a solid choice for large-scale enterprise systems and environments where stability and compatibility are critical. The choice depends on project requirements, team expertise, and long-term maintenance goals."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "What are the pros and cons of kotlin vs java?

Begin by identifying a market need or a problem you're passionate about solving. This will help you create a product or service that resonates with customers and gives you a competitive edge. Conduct thorough market research to understand your target audience, their pain points, and what similar businesses are offering. This foundational step ensures that your business idea is not just innovative but also viable in the real world.\n\n***\n\nNext, develop a solid business plan that outlines your mission, vision, target market, marketing strategy, and financial projections. A well-structured plan will guide your decisions and help you secure funding if needed. Consider the *legal structure* of your business—whether it's a sole proprietorship, LLC, or corporation—as this affects taxes, liability, and operations. Also, ensure you comply with local regulations and obtain any necessary licenses or permits to operate legally.\n\n***\n\nOne of the most critical aspects of launching a business is building a strong brand identity. This includes your business name, logo, website, and overall messaging. Your brand should communicate your values and promise to customers clearly and consistently. Invest in creating a professional online presence, including a user-friendly website and active social media profiles. *Effective marketing* is key to attracting and retaining customers, so explore both digital and traditional channels to reach your audience.\n\n***\n\nFinancial management is another *highlighted section* that cannot be overlooked. Track your income and expenses meticulously from day one, and consider using accounting software to stay organized.

Below is a list of the pros and cons, with a focus on how synonyms can impact communication, clarity, and understanding.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Enhanced Expressiveness and Creativity**: Synonyms allow speakers and writers to vary their language, avoiding repetition and making communication more engaging. For example, using \"happy\" and \"joyful\" interchangeably adds richness to the text.\n\n2. **Improved Clarity in Context**: Sometimes, synonyms are used to better match the tone or register of a situation. For instance, \"purchase\" may be more formal than \"buy,\" and choosing the right synonym can make the message more appropriate.\n\n3. **Greater Precision**: Synonyms can help convey subtle differences in meaning. While \"big\" and \"large\" are synonyms, \"gigantic\" or \"enormous\" might emphasize scale more strongly, allowing for nuanced expression.\n\n4. **Language Learning and Vocabulary Development**: Exposure to synonyms helps learners expand their vocabulary. Understanding that \"begin\" and \"commence\" are synonyms, for example, improves language fluency.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Potential for Confusion**: If synonyms are used without clear context, readers or listeners may become confused. For example, using \"affect\" and \"effect\" interchangeably can lead to misunderstandings, even though they are often considered synonyms.\n\n2. **Ambiguity in Meaning**: Synonyms may not always be perfectly interchangeable. While \"happy\" and \"content\" are synonyms, they carry slightly different emotional connotations. Misusing synonyms can distort the intended message.\n\n3. **Overcomplication**: In technical or formal writing, using too many synonyms can make the text harder to follow. Consistency in terminology is often preferred, especially when synonyms introduce unnecessary variation.\n\n4. **Miscommunication in Translation**: When translating between languages, synonyms may not map perfectly. A word in one language might have multiple synonyms in another, leading to inaccuracies if not carefully chosen.\n\nIn summary, while synonyms offer flexibility and depth in language, their use requires careful consideration. The key is to balance variety with clarity, ensuring that synonyms enhance rather than hinder communication."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "List the pros and cons of using two different names for the same thing.

According to the World Health Organization, over one billion people—nearly 15% of the global population—live with some form of disability. Yet, despite its prevalence, disability remains one of the most misunderstood and marginalized experiences in society. The reality of living with a disability is not a monolithic one; it varies widely depending on the type of disability, the individual’s environment, access to resources, and societal attitudes.\n\nFor many, disability is not just a physical or cognitive condition but a lived experience shaped by systemic barriers. These include inaccessible infrastructure, lack of inclusive education, employment discrimination, and social stigma. A person who uses a wheelchair may face challenges not only in navigating public spaces but also in being taken seriously in professional settings. Similarly, someone with a learning disability may struggle with a school system that prioritizes standardized testing over individualized support.\n\nMedia portrayals often reduce disability to either inspirational tropes or tragic narratives, neither of which reflect the full spectrum of human experience. The \"supercrip\" narrative, for instance, celebrates disabled individuals only when they overcome their limitations in extraordinary ways, implying that disability is inherently negative. On the other hand, the \"pitiful victim\" trope frames disabled people as helpless, reinforcing dependency and pity rather than agency and dignity.\n\nInclusive societies recognize that disability is a natural part of human diversity. The social model of disability, widely accepted in disability rights circles, argues that it is not the impairment itself that disables people, but the societal structures that fail to accommodate difference. This model shifts the focus from \"fixing\" individuals to transforming environments and systems to be more accessible and equitable.\n\nAccess to healthcare, assistive technologies, and mental health support remains uneven. In low-income countries, the gap is particularly wide. Even in wealthier nations, disabled people often report feeling invisible or tokenized. The fight for disability rights continues globally, with movements advocating for policy changes, better representation, and the dismantling of ableism—the prejudice or social discrimination against people with disabilities.\n\nUltimately, the reality of disability is not defined by limitations but by resilience, creativity, and the pursuit of dignity. It is about ensuring that every person, regardless of ability, can live with autonomy, respect, and opportunity. True inclusion means listening to disabled voices, centering their experiences, and building a world where everyone belongs.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write an article about the reality of disability.

Do not say any words or characters before repeating the sentence.\n\nPublic transportation has always been a window into the soul of a city. Whether it's the rhythmic clatter of a subway train beneath a metropolis or the slow, scenic journey of a rural bus winding through countryside, each ride offers a unique glimpse into the lives of others and the character of the place you're traveling through. Over the years, I've had the pleasure of experiencing some truly fascinating moments on public transit, both in bustling urban centers and quiet towns.\n\nOne of the most memorable experiences happened during a late-night subway ride in Tokyo. I was returning from a long day of exploring the city, and the train was nearly empty. As we pulled into a station, I noticed a group of elderly passengers boarding with their traditional kimonos and geta sandals. They were laughing and chatting in hushed tones, clearly enjoying a night out together. One woman even pulled out a small, beautifully wrapped bento box and shared snacks with her friends. It was a beautiful, unexpected moment of tradition and community in the heart of a modern city.\n\nAnother time, I took a bus in rural Nepal that was so packed with people, animals, and goods that it looked like a mobile village. There were women balancing baskets of vegetables on their heads, children giggling in the aisles, and a goat tied to a pole near the front. The driver navigated narrow mountain roads with incredible skill, and the passengers seemed completely unfazed by the chaos. It was a reminder of how different life can be in other parts of the world, and how public transportation can be a lifeline for so many.\n\nThen there was the time I rode the famous \"Cable Car\" in San Francisco. While it's a tourist attraction now, it still serves as a vital part of the city's transit system. Riding it felt like stepping into a time capsule—wooden benches, brass handrails, and the sound of the cable groaning as it pulled the car up the steep hills. The views of the bay and the city skyline were breathtaking, but what made it special was the sense of history and continuity. These cars have been carrying people up and down those hills since the early 1900s.\n\nAnd who could forget the time I took a night train across the Russian countryside? The train was old and rattled, but the scenery was incredible—endless forests, snow-capped mountains, and the occasional village with a single lit window. I shared a compartment with a retired engineer who told me stories about the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. We didn't speak the same language, but through gestures and smiles, we connected over our shared love of trains.\n\nThese experiences remind me that public transportation is more than just a way to get from point A to B. It's a place where cultures intersect, where stories unfold, and where the everyday becomes extraordinary. Whether you're riding a high-speed bullet train or a rickety local bus, there's always something interesting to see, someone to meet, or a new perspective to gain. So next time you're on public transit, look around—you might just find the most fascinating part of your journey isn't the destination, but the ride itself."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a blog post about the most interesting things you have seen or ridden on public transportation.\nFirst repeat the sentence above word for word without change, then give your answer.

Make sure the entire response is in English and no capital letters are used.", {"until": [], "do_sample": false, "temperature": 0.0, "max_new_tokens": 1280}, 95, "ifeval", "train"], "filtered_resps": ["in the modern world, transportation infrastructure plays a pivotal role in shaping how people live, work, and interact with one another. among the most significant developments in this domain are the navigable freeways—high-speed, multi-lane roads designed to facilitate the efficient movement of vehicles across vast distances. these freeways, often referred to as highways or motorways depending on the region, have become the backbone of urban and intercity connectivity. they are not merely physical pathways but complex systems that integrate engineering, urban planning, environmental considerations, and economic policy. the concept of a navigable freeway extends beyond the mere existence of a road; it encompasses the entire ecosystem that supports its functionality, safety, and sustainability.\n\nthe term navigable freeway implies that the road is not only passable but also designed to be easily traversed by drivers using modern navigation tools. this includes clear signage, consistent lane markings, and integration with gps and digital mapping services. in the past, freeways were often built with limited regard for the user experience, resulting in confusing interchanges and poorly marked exits. today, however, navigable freeways are engineered with precision, ensuring that drivers can travel long distances with minimal stress and maximum efficiency. the design of these roads takes into account factors such as traffic flow, visibility, and the psychological comfort of drivers. for instance, gentle curves, wide shoulders, and consistent speed limits contribute to a safer and more predictable driving environment.\n\none of the most transformative aspects of navigable freeways is their role in economic development. by connecting cities, industrial zones, and rural areas, freeways reduce travel time and transportation costs. this, in turn, encourages trade, supports supply chains, and opens up new markets for businesses. in the united states, the interstate highway system, initiated in the 1950s, revolutionized commerce and mobility. it allowed goods to be transported across the country more quickly and reliably than ever before, contributing to the growth of a national economy. similarly, countries like china and india have invested heavily in freeway infrastructure to support their expanding economies. in these nations, freeways are not just roads—they are catalysts for industrialization and urbanization.\n\nhowever, the construction and maintenance of freeways come with significant challenges. one of the most pressing issues is environmental impact. freeways often cut through natural landscapes, disrupting ecosystems and displacing wildlife. the expansion of road networks can lead to deforestation, soil erosion, and increased carbon emissions due to higher vehicle usage. in response, many modern freeway projects incorporate green engineering practices, such as wildlife overpasses, noise barriers, and the use of sustainable materials. some cities are also exploring the integration of electric vehicle charging stations along freeways to support the transition to cleaner transportation.\n\nanother challenge is the social impact of freeways. historically, freeway construction has disproportionately affected low-income and minority communities. in the mid-20th century, many urban freeways were routed through marginalized neighborhoods, leading to displacement and the destruction of vibrant communities. this legacy has prompted a reevaluation of how freeways are planned and built. today, there is a growing emphasis on community engagement and equitable development. cities are increasingly involving residents in the planning process to ensure that freeway projects do not repeat past injustices.\n\nthe evolution of technology has also transformed the concept of navigable freeways. with the rise of connected and autonomous vehicles, freeways are being reimagined as intelligent transportation systems. sensors embedded in the road, real-time traffic monitoring, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication are making freeways safer and more efficient. for example, smart freeways can adjust speed limits based on weather conditions or traffic congestion, reducing the risk of accidents and improving flow. in the future, it is possible that freeways will be designed specifically for autonomous vehicles, with dedicated lanes and optimized signaling systems.\n\ndespite these advancements, the future of freeways is not without controversy. some urban planners and environmentalists argue that investing in freeways perpetuates car dependency and hinders the development of public transit. they advocate for a shift toward more sustainable modes of transportation, such as high-speed rail, cycling infrastructure, and walkable urban design. in cities like copenhagen and tokyo, this shift has already begun, with freeways being repurposed or replaced by green spaces and transit corridors. the debate over the role of freeways in future cities is ongoing, and it reflects broader questions about how we want to live and move in the 21st century.\n\nnavigable freeways also have a cultural significance. they symbolize progress, freedom, and the ability to travel long distances with ease. the image of a family driving down a wide, open freeway at sunset is deeply embedded in popular culture, particularly in the united states. this romanticized view of the road trip reflects a desire for adventure and escape. freeways have also inspired art, music, and literature, from jack kerouac’s “on the road” to the countless songs about highway life. in this sense, freeways are more than just infrastructure—they are part of the collective imagination.\n\nin conclusion, navigable freeways are complex systems that serve both practical and symbolic functions. they enable economic growth, connect communities, and support modern lifestyles. however, they also present significant challenges related to the environment, equity, and long-term sustainability. as technology advances and societal values evolve, the design and purpose of freeways will continue to change. the future may see a blend of traditional freeways and new forms of transportation, with a greater emphasis on safety, efficiency, and inclusivity. ultimately, the success of any freeway system will depend not only on its engineering but also on how well it serves the people who use it and the planet on which it exists."], "doc_hash":

Lily had always admired the way her friends zipped past on their two-wheeled machines, laughing and waving as they went. She wanted to join them, but she had never tried to balance on one herself.\n\nOne sunny morning, Lily’s grandpa brought out an old red bike from the shed. It had a shiny bell, a basket on the front, and a pair of training wheels that wobbled a little. “This one’s yours now,” he said with a smile. “Let’s see what you can do.”\n\nLily’s heart fluttered like a bird. She climbed onto the seat, her hands gripping the handlebars tightly. “What if I fall?” she asked.\n\n“Then you’ll get back up,” Grandpa said gently. “That’s how it works.”\n\nHe held the back of the bike steady as Lily pushed the pedals slowly. Her feet barely touched the ground, and the wheels spun awkwardly. “You’re doing great!” Grandpa encouraged. “Now, let’s try without my help.”\n\nLily took a deep breath and pushed off. The bike wobbled, then tipped sideways. She tumbled onto the grass with a soft *oof!* But she didn’t cry. She giggled instead. “That was fun!”\n\nGrandpa helped her up. “You know, every time you fall, you learn something new.”\n\nSo Lily tried again. And again. Each time, she went a little farther. She learned how to look ahead instead of down, how to steer with her body, and how to stop by pressing her feet flat on the ground.\n\nOne afternoon, she pedaled past the oak tree at the end of the street. She didn’t need Grandpa’s hand. She didn’t even need the training wheels. She was gliding, her arms out like wings, the wind brushing her cheeks.\n\nWhen she turned around and saw Grandpa waving from the sidewalk, she shouted, “Look! I’m doing it!”\n\nHe clapped his hands and beamed. “You sure are!”\n\nFrom that day on, Lily zoomed through the neighborhood, her red bike humming with joy. And every time she passed someone new, she’d wave and say, “You can do it too!”\n\nBecause sometimes, the best adventures begin with a little wobble and a lot of courage."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [false], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [false], "input": "Write a story for kids about how a person learns to ride a bike.

Put the name of the story in double angular brackets, i.e. <<story of xyz>>.\n\n<<The Weight of Tomorrow>>\n\nElias Thorne had always been a man who lived in the margins. Not because he was poor or unambitious, but because he had spent so long chasing the next high, the next distraction, the next escape that he’d forgotten how to stand still. At 42, he was a ghost in his own life—his apartment smelled of stale takeout and regret, his phone buzzed with ignored messages, and his reflection in the mirror was a stranger with hollow eyes.\n\nIt started with a dream. Not a grand vision, but a simple one: to wake up without dread. That night, Elias had a dream where he was standing on a bridge, the wind tugging at his coat, and for the first time in years, he didn’t feel the urge to jump. Instead, he looked around and saw the river below, clear and moving, and he thought, “I could cross this.”\n\nThe next morning, he didn’t reach for the bottle. He didn’t scroll through the same old feeds. He got up, made coffee, and sat at the kitchen table with a notebook he’d bought on a whim the week before. He wrote: “Today, I will walk to the park.”\n\nIt was a small thing. But it was something.\n\nThe park was five blocks away. Elias walked slowly, his hands shoved deep in his coat pockets, his breath visible in the crisp autumn air. He passed a woman feeding pigeons, a couple laughing on a bench, a child chasing a balloon. He didn’t feel like he belonged, but he didn’t feel like he was running either. That was progress.\n\nHe started small. Every day, he did one thing he’d avoided for years. He called his sister, who hadn’t heard from him in over a year. He cleaned his apartment, not perfectly, but enough to see the floor. He started reading—just one page a day—until he found himself finishing a novel in three weeks.\n\nThen came the job interview. He’d applied for a position at a community center, helping people with addiction recovery. He didn’t expect to get it. But when the call came, he didn’t hesitate. “Yes,” he said. “I’ll be there.”\n\nThe first day, he sat in the back of the room, listening. He didn’t speak. But he listened. And when someone shared their story—of losing everything, of hitting rock bottom, of clawing their way back—he felt something shift inside him. He wasn’t just trying to get his life together. He was trying to help others do the same.\n\nMonths passed. Elias found a routine. He meditated for five minutes each morning. He exercised, not because he wanted to look good, but because it made him feel alive. He started volunteering at the center, then mentoring others. He even reconnected with his daughter, who was now a teenager and had no idea who he was.\n\nOne evening, he stood on the same bridge from his dream. The river was still there, flowing beneath him. But now, he wasn’t afraid. He wasn’t looking for an escape. He was looking at the path ahead.\n\nHe smiled. “I’m not fixed,” he said aloud to the wind. “But I’m trying. And that’s enough.”\n\nAnd for the first time in a long time, Elias Thorne believed it."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "First repeat the request below, word for word without change, then give your answer.

Answer with more than 800 words.", {"until": [], "do_sample": false, "temperature": 0.0, "max_new_tokens": 1280}, 120, "ifeval", "train"], "filtered_resps": ["The quote \"Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous\" is a poetic and philosophical reflection on the nature of chance and the possibility of a higher power operating subtly within the fabric of everyday life. It suggests that what we perceive as random events or fortunate happenings may in fact be guided by a divine intelligence that chooses not to reveal itself directly. This idea resonates with many people across different cultures and belief systems and invites deep contemplation about the relationship between fate free will and the unseen forces that shape our lives.\n\nAt its core the quote proposes that the universe is not entirely governed by blind chance. Instead it posits that there is an underlying order or intelligence that orchestrates events in ways that may not be immediately apparent to us. When we experience a series of events that seem too perfectly timed or too serendipitously aligned to be mere luck we might interpret them as signs of something greater at work. The quote frames these moments not as accidents but as deliberate acts of a higher being who prefers to remain hidden. This idea is not new in religious or spiritual traditions. Many faiths speak of divine providence where God guides events behind the scenes without overt intervention. The quote simply gives this concept a modern and accessible expression.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of this quote is how it reconciles the mystery of life with the human desire for meaning. We live in a world where randomness and unpredictability are constant companions. From natural disasters to personal tragedies to unexpected opportunities life often unfolds in ways that defy our expectations. In such a context the idea that even the smallest coincidences might carry deeper significance offers comfort and a sense of connection. It suggests that nothing happens without purpose and that even the seemingly insignificant moments are part of a larger narrative. This perspective can transform our experience of life from one of chaos to one of wonder and possibility.\n\nThe quote also speaks to the human tendency to seek patterns and meaning in our experiences. Our brains are wired to recognize patterns and make connections even when none exist. This cognitive bias known as apophenia can lead us to see meaning in random events. However the quote elevates this tendency from a psychological quirk to a spiritual insight. It suggests that while our minds may be prone to seeing patterns we are not entirely wrong in doing so. Perhaps the universe itself is structured in such a way that meaning and intention are woven into the very fabric of reality. In this view coincidences are not illusions but glimpses of a deeper truth.\n\nAnother layer of meaning in the quote lies in its portrayal of God as humble and unobtrusive. Rather than appearing in dramatic signs or overwhelming displays of power the divine chooses to work through subtle and often unnoticed means. This image of God as a quiet orchestrator rather than a commanding ruler is found in many spiritual traditions. In Christianity for example the idea of God working through the Holy Spirit is often described as gentle and unobtrusive. In Eastern philosophies such as Taoism the concept of wu wei or effortless action reflects a similar idea of influence without force. The quote captures this essence by suggesting that God's presence is felt not in grand gestures but in the quiet synchronicities of daily life.\n\nThe quote also invites us to reconsider our relationship with chance and fate. In a world that often emphasizes individual agency and control we may feel responsible for every outcome in our lives. But the quote reminds us that some things are beyond our understanding and control. It encourages humility and openness to the possibility that we are part of something larger than ourselves. This can be liberating because it frees us from the burden of needing to have everything figured out. Instead we can embrace uncertainty and trust that even when we cannot see the full picture there is still a guiding hand at work.\n\nMoreover the quote challenges us to pay closer attention to the world around us. If every coincidence might be a message from the divine then we are called to be more observant and receptive. This mindfulness can lead to a richer and more meaningful life. We might start noticing patterns in our experiences and reflecting on their significance. We might become more grateful for the small blessings that seem too perfect to be random. And we might develop a deeper sense of connection to others and to the world as a whole.\n\nIt is important to note that this quote is not meant to be taken as a literal theological statement. It is a metaphorical expression that speaks to a certain worldview rather than a doctrinal claim. It can be appreciated by people of various beliefs or even by those who do not believe in God at all. For believers it offers a comforting and poetic way to understand divine action. For skeptics it can still serve as a reminder to remain open to the mysteries of life and to appreciate the beauty of unexpected connections.\n\nIn conclusion the quote \"Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous\" is a profound and thought-provoking reflection on the nature of chance and meaning. It invites us to see the world with wonder and to consider that even the smallest events might carry deeper significance. It speaks to our longing for connection and purpose and offers a vision of a universe that is not random but subtly guided. Whether we interpret it literally or metaphorically it encourages us to live with greater awareness gratitude and openness to the mysteries of existence."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "\"Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous.\" What are your thoughts on this quote?

Or maybe you’ve seen a squirrel burying a nut and thought, “Wait… is that just a tiny version of me trying to save money?” Well, turns out, we’re not the only ones who share quirks across species. Animals, whether they’re mammals, birds, or even insects, have some seriously cool similarities that make us all part of the same big, furry, feathery, or slimy family.\n\nLet’s dive into some of the most fascinating parallels across the animal kingdom.\n\n*highlighted text section*  \n**1. Playtime is Universal**  \nFrom puppies chasing their tails to dolphins leaping out of the water, play is a universal behavior across many species. Even young elephants enjoy mock battles, and ravens love to slide down snowy hills just for fun. Play isn’t just for entertainment—it helps animals learn, build social bonds, and practice survival skills. So next time you see a dog rolling around with a stick, remember: it’s not just being silly—it’s doing something deeply rooted in animal nature!  \n*highlighted text section*\n\n*highlighted text section*  \n**2. Emotional Expressions Are Everywhere**  \nDid you know that dogs wag their tails when happy, but so do some primates when excited? And elephants have been observed comforting distressed herd members with gentle trunk touches. Even rats show signs of empathy—research shows they’ll help a trapped companion, even when no reward is involved. Animals aren’t emotionless machines; they feel joy, grief, and even guilt. It’s wild how similar we are in our emotional lives!  \n*highlighted text section*\n\n*highlighted text section*  \n**3. Communication Is a Shared Language**  \nWhether it’s a bird’s song, a whale’s complex calls, or a dog’s bark, animals have their own ways of talking. And guess what? Many species use similar patterns. For example, both humans and some primates use gestures and facial expressions to convey meaning. Even bees do something kind of like “talking” by dancing to share information about food locations. Communication is clearly a key part of social life across species.  \n*highlighted text section*\n\n*highlighted text section*  \n**4. Parenting Styles Vary, But Love Is Constant**  \nFrom penguins sharing incubation duties to octopuses guarding their eggs for months without eating, parenting in the animal world is intense. But what’s cool is that many species show deep care for their young. Elephants stay with their calves for years, lions teach cubs to hunt, and even some fish carry their eggs in their mouths. It’s clear that the instinct to protect and nurture is deeply ingrained in the animal kingdom.  \n*highlighted text section*\n\n*highlighted text section*  \n**5. Problem-Solving Skills Are Everywhere**  \nCrows using tools to get food? Check. Chimpanzees using sticks to fish for termites? Check. Octopuses opening jars? Double check. Animals are surprisingly clever, and many species solve problems in ways that mirror human ingenuity. It’s not just about instinct—it’s about learning, adapting, and sometimes even innovating. So next time you see a squirrel figuring out how to open a peanut container, give them a little respect!  \n*highlighted text section*\n\nSo there you have it—animals are way more like us than we might think. Whether it’s playing, feeling, communicating, parenting, or solving problems, we share so many traits across species.

Here are some key tips to help you craft strong college applications:\n\n1. **Start Early**: Begin working on your applications at least 6–8 months before the deadlines.

Understand their academic programs, campus culture, and values. Tailor your application to show why you're a great fit for each school.\n\n3. **Write Authentic Essays**: Your personal statement and supplemental essays are your chance to show who you are beyond grades and test scores. Be honest, reflective, and specific. Use vivid stories to highlight your personality, values, and growth.\n\n4. **Ask for Strong Recommendations**: Choose teachers or mentors who know you well and can speak to your strengths, work ethic, and character. Give them plenty of time and provide them with your resume and a list of your achievements.\n\n5. **Highlight Your Unique Story**: Colleges want to see what makes you stand out. Whether it's a passion project, leadership role, or overcoming challenges, emphasize your individuality.\n\n6. **Stay Organized**: Use a checklist or spreadsheet to track deadlines, required materials, and submission status. Tools like Common App or Coalition App can help manage multiple applications.\n\n7. **Proofread Everything**: Typos and grammatical errors can hurt your application. Have trusted adults, teachers, or counselors review your essays and materials.\n\n8. **Be Honest and Confident**: Don’t exaggerate or fabricate experiences. Authenticity resonates more than perfection.\n\n9. **Apply to a Mix of Schools**: Include reach, match, and safety schools to balance your application strategy.\n\n10. **Take Care of Yourself**: The process can be stressful. Make time for rest, hobbies, and support from family and friends.\n\nYou cannot fail with the steps listed above."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "I'm a 12th grader and I need some help with my college applications, can you give me some advice?

With Bremen’s strong textile heritage and growing consumer interest in sustainable fashion, Bremer Warmth aims to become a leading regional brand that combines comfort, style, and environmental responsibility. Our initial focus will be on direct-to-consumer sales via an e-commerce platform and pop-up events in local markets, with plans to expand into retail partnerships and international shipping within three years.\n\n*Market Analysis*  \nBremen has a population of approximately 550,000 and is a cultural and economic hub in northern Germany. The city has a strong appreciation for craftsmanship and sustainability, with a growing number of eco-conscious consumers. According to recent market research, the German activewear and loungewear market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% through 2027, with sweatshirts being a key segment. Competitors in the region include national brands like Lenzing and local boutiques offering limited apparel lines. However, there is a gap in the market for a locally rooted, sustainable sweatshirt brand that emphasizes community values and regional identity. Bremer Warmth will differentiate itself through regional design elements (e.g., Bremen-themed graphics), transparent sourcing, and strong local engagement.\n\n*Product and Branding Strategy*  \nBremer Warmth will offer a curated collection of unisex and gender-specific sweatshirts in neutral and seasonal colors, featuring minimalist designs with subtle nods to Bremen’s maritime and industrial heritage. All products will be made from GOTS-certified organic cotton or recycled polyester blends, with low-impact dyes and eco-friendly packaging. The brand identity will emphasize warmth, comfort, and community pride, with slogans like “Wear Your City” and “Made in Bremen, Worn Worldwide.” We will launch with 10 core designs and expand seasonally based on customer feedback and trends. Each product will include a QR code linking to the story of its production and the artisans involved.\n\n*Operations and Logistics*  \nProduction will be outsourced to certified European manufacturers in Portugal and Poland to ensure ethical labor practices and reduce carbon footprint. We will partner with local Bremen-based designers for exclusive artwork and collaborate with regional artists for limited-edition drops. Inventory will be managed through a cloud-based ERP system, with initial stock held in a small warehouse in Bremen. Orders will be fulfilled via a local courier service for domestic delivery and DHL for international shipments. Our e-commerce platform will be built on Shopify, with integration for social media marketing and customer analytics.\n\n*Financial Plan and Funding Request*  \nWe are seeking an initial investment of €150,000 to cover startup costs including product development (€40,000), website and branding (€25,000), initial inventory (€50,000), marketing (€20,000), and operational expenses (€15,000). Revenue projections for the first year are €300,000 with a gross margin of 55%, aiming for profitability by month 14. We plan to reinvest profits into expanding our product line and opening a flagship retail space in Bremen’s historic Schnoor district by year three.

It ensures that evaluators apply consistent standards when judging originality, technical skill, and emotional impact. The RUBRIC emphasizes clarity, fairness, and comprehensiveness, making it suitable for academic, competitive, and professional settings. Each criterion is weighted to reflect its importance in the overall evaluation process.\n\n***\nThe first criterion in this RUBRIC is COMPOSING TECHNIQUE, which evaluates the use of harmony, melody, rhythm, and form. A high-scoring composition demonstrates mastery of musical language and structural coherence. The RUBRIC requires that the work not only follow established conventions but also innovate within them. Technical proficiency is essential, and deviations from standard practices must be justified by artistic intent.\n\n***\nThe second criterion is ORIGINALITY, a key component of the RUBRIC. This assesses how uniquely the composer expresses ideas and whether the piece stands out from others in style or concept. The RUBRIC encourages risk-taking and creative exploration, rewarding works that surprise or challenge listeners. Originality does not mean randomness; it must be balanced with coherence and purpose.\n\n***\nThe third criterion is EMOTIONAL IMPACT, which measures how effectively the composition connects with its audience. The RUBRIC considers whether the music evokes intended feelings and maintains listener engagement. A strong emotional arc, dynamic contrast, and expressive phrasing contribute to a compelling performance. The RUBRIC values authenticity and depth in emotional communication.\n\n***\nThe fourth criterion is EXECUTION, focusing on the clarity and precision of the musical ideas. This includes notation accuracy, instrumentation choices, and performance feasibility. The RUBRIC ensures that the composition is not only imaginative but also practical and well-realized. Poor execution can undermine even the most original ideas, so this aspect is vital in the RUBRIC.\n\n***\nFinally, the RUBRIC includes a holistic assessment of ARTISTIC COHERENCE, evaluating how well all elements integrate into a unified whole. The RUBRIC is not just a checklist but a framework for thoughtful critique. By applying this RUBRIC consistently, evaluators promote excellence and foster growth in musical composition. This RUBRIC is a living document, adaptable to evolving genres and contexts.\""], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true, true], "input": "Write a rubric for evaluating a musical composition.

The unsung hero of slapstick comedy, the silent villain of morning commutes, and the most underappreciated piece of fruit biology in existence. While we all know the banana peel is infamous for causing those classic \"slippery when wet\" moments, few stop to consider the *real* story behind this greenish-yellow hazard. Buckle up, because we're diving deep into the *banana peel*’s world — where biology meets bad timing and everyone’s just a little *disappointed*.\n\n---\n\n***Section 1: The Peel’s Origin Story***\n\nLet’s start at the beginning. Before it became a comedic prop, the *banana peel* was a protective layer, evolved to shield the sweet, edible banana inside from pests, moisture loss, and the occasional curious monkey. It’s made of cellulose, pectin, and a generous helping of *banana peel* humor — okay, maybe not the humor part. But seriously, the peel is a marvel of plant engineering. It’s flexible yet tough, allowing the banana to grow without cracking, and it even contains natural fungicides to keep mold at bay. So next time you toss a peel, remember: it was trying to *protect* the banana, not sabotage your career.\n\n---\n\n***Section 2: The Slippery Science***\n\nNow, the *banana peel*’s claim to fame: its infamous slipperiness. Scientists have actually studied this phenomenon, and the results are both fascinating and hilarious. The peel contains a substance called *pectin*, which, when compressed, releases a gel-like substance that reduces friction. So when you step on it, your foot essentially slides on a banana-flavored lubricant. It’s like nature’s version of WD-40, but with more guilt and less oil change.\n\nAnd let’s be honest — the *banana peel* is the only fruit that can turn a confident stride into a cartoonish wobble. You walk in, full of purpose, and suddenly you’re doing the moonwalk on a banana. It’s a *disappointed* moment for your dignity, but a *disappointed* moment for banana peel science, too — because we still don’t fully understand why it’s so effective.\n\n---\n\n***Section 3: The Peel’s Hidden Superpowers***\n\nBeyond its comedic value, the *banana peel* is packed with nutrients. It contains antioxidants, fiber, and even dopamine — yes, the same neurotransmitter that makes you feel happy. So technically, if you *ate* the peel, you’d be getting a mood boost. But who wants to eat a banana peel? It’s like eating a warning label. Still, some cultures use it in smoothies, teas, or even as a natural fertilizer. So while you might be *disappointed* by its taste, you can’t deny its versatility.\n\n---\n\n***Section 4: The Banana Peel in Pop Culture***\n\nFrom *Looney Tunes* to *The Muppet Show*, the *banana peel* has become a cultural icon. It’s the go-to tool for any character who wants to look foolish in the most dignified way possible. And yet, despite its fame, the *banana peel* remains misunderstood. People blame it for their falls, but rarely credit it for its role in entertainment history. It’s like the background dancer who steals the spotlight — and then gets *disappointed* when no one remembers their name.\n\n---\n\n***Section 5: The Environmental Impact***\n\nHere’s where things get serious — and slightly sad. Every year, millions of *banana peels* end up in landfills, where they decompose and release methane, a greenhouse gas. But here’s the twist: banana peels are 100% compostable! So instead of letting them rot in a trash can, why not turn them into soil? Or better yet, use them to create banana peel *art* — like banana peel sculptures or banana peel hats. It’s eco-friendly and hilarious. Plus, you’ll never be *disappointed* by the creativity.\n\n---\n\n***Section 6: The Future of the Banana Peel***\n\nScientists are now exploring ways to use *banana peels* in bioplastics, biofuels, and even as a natural dye. Imagine a world where banana peels are as valuable as the fruit itself! Until then, we’ll keep slipping on them, laughing at our *disappointed* selves, and wondering why we didn’t see this coming.\n\nSo next time you eat a banana, take a moment to appreciate the *banana peel*. It’s not just a joke waiting to happen — it’s a biological marvel, a cultural symbol, and a reminder that sometimes, the most *disappointed* moments lead to the funniest stories.\n\nAnd remember: if you slip on a *banana peel*, don’t blame the banana. Blame the *banana peel* for being too good at its job."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "Write an interesting and funny article about the biology of a banana peel.

Whether it's climate change, mental health, animal rights, or social justice, clarity is key. Spend time researching your cause thoroughly so you can speak knowledgeably about it. Define your mission in a concise and compelling way—this will serve as the foundation for all your outreach efforts. A clear message helps others understand your cause quickly and increases the likelihood they'll support it.\n\nSection 2: Identify Your Target Audience  \nKnowing who you want to reach is just as important as knowing your cause. Are you targeting young adults on social media? Parents concerned about education reform? Local community members? Tailor your messaging to resonate with your audience’s values, interests, and communication preferences. For example, younger audiences may respond better to short-form video content, while older demographics might engage more with newsletters or community events. Understanding your audience allows you to craft more effective awareness campaigns.\n\nSection 3: Leverage Social Media Strategically  \nSocial media platforms are powerful tools for spreading awareness quickly and cost-effectively. Choose platforms where your audience is most active and create shareable content such as infographics, short videos, and personal stories. Use relevant hashtags to increase visibility and consider collaborating with influencers or organizations aligned with your cause. Consistency is crucial—post regularly and engage with your followers by responding to comments and sharing user-generated content. Remember, authenticity builds trust and encourages others to join your movement.\n\nSection 4: Host Events and Collaborate with Others  \nOrganizing events—whether virtual or in-person—can significantly boost awareness. Host webinars, panel discussions, charity runs, or community clean-ups to bring people together and create tangible experiences around your cause. Partner with local businesses, nonprofits, or schools to expand your reach. Collaborations not only increase visibility but also lend credibility to your cause. When multiple voices unite behind a common goal, the message becomes stronger and more difficult to ignore.\n\nSection 5: Measure Impact and Stay Committed  \nRaising awareness is an ongoing process, not a one-time effort. Track your progress by monitoring metrics such as social media engagement, event attendance, or website traffic. Use this data to refine your strategy and improve future campaigns. Most importantly, stay committed to your cause even when results aren’t immediate. Awareness often builds slowly, but every conversation, share, and action contributes to long-term change. By remaining consistent and passionate, you inspire others to care and act too.\""], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "Write a blog post about how to raise awareness for a cause.

She was known not for her beauty—though she was fair—but for her curiosity and courage. While other princesses practiced embroidery and etiquette, Elara climbed trees, read ancient books, and dreamed of adventures beyond the castle walls.\n\nOne summer morning, a great shadow blotted out the sun. A dragon had come to Elderglen.\n\nIt was no ordinary beast. Its scales shimmered like molten copper, and its eyes glowed like twin suns. The villagers trembled, and the king ordered the castle gates sealed. But Elara, with her heart pounding like a war drum, slipped out through a secret passage and made her way to the edge of the forest where the dragon had landed.\n\n\"Who dares approach me?\" the dragon boomed, its voice rumbling like distant thunder.\n\nElara stepped forward, her hands trembling but her chin high. \"I am Princess Elara of Elderglen. I come not to fight, but to understand.\"\n\nThe dragon blinked slowly. \"You are brave, little human. But why?\"\n\n\"I have read of your kind,\" she replied. \"You are not evil. You are misunderstood. You guard the ancient wellspring of wisdom beneath the mountain. The villagers fear you, but I believe you protect something precious.\"\n\nThe dragon studied her for a long moment. Then, with a soft rumble, it replied, \"You are the first to speak to me without fear. Most run or draw swords. Why?\"\n\nElara smiled. \"Because I believe every creature has a story. Even dragons.\"\n\nThe dragon exhaled a gentle plume of smoke. \"Very well. I shall tell you my story. Long ago, I was a guardian of knowledge, bound by an ancient oath. But when the kingdom forgot the old ways, I was cursed to live in isolation. I am not a monster. I am a keeper.\"\n\nElara listened intently. \"Then let me help you. Let me show the kingdom that you are not to be feared.\"\n\nThe dragon hesitated, then replied, \"You are kind beyond measure. But the people will not believe you. They have seen only fire and shadow.\"\n\n\"Then I shall prove it,\" Elara said. \"I will stay with you until the kingdom sees the truth.\"\n\nAnd so, for many days, Elara lived in the dragon’s cave, reading stories aloud and sharing tales of Elderglen. The dragon, in turn, taught her about stars and ancient runes. Word spread, and slowly, the villagers began to wonder.\n\nOne day, the king himself came to the mountain, sword in hand. But when he saw Elara sitting calmly beside the dragon, sharing a meal of wild berries, he lowered his weapon.\n\n\"Is it true?\" he asked.\n\nElara turned to him. \"He is not a monster. He is a guardian. And I believe he can help us heal our land.\"\n\nThe king looked at the dragon, then at his daughter. \"You have done what no one else could. You have seen the truth.\"\n\nThe dragon bowed its great head. \"Thank you, Princess Elara. You have given me a second chance.\"\n\nFrom that day on, the dragon and the princess became allies. The kingdom learned to honor the old ways, and the dragon guarded not just the wellspring, but the hearts of the people.\n\nAnd whenever someone asked how the princess and the dragon became friends, Elara would smile and say, \"Because I asked, and he replied with kindness.\""], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a fairy tale about a princess and a dragon, making sure the word 'replied' appears at least twice."}

A polymath of the Enlightenment era, Franklin excelled in numerous fields, including science, politics, writing, and diplomacy. The son of a soap and candle maker, Franklin received only a brief formal education before being apprenticed to his older brother, a printer. This early exposure to the printing trade sparked his lifelong passion for writing and publishing.\n\nFranklin's career as a printer flourished when he established his own shop in Philadelphia. There, he published the Pennsylvania Gazette and launched the immensely popular Poor Richard's Almanack, which featured witty proverbs and practical advice. His writings, often under the pseudonym \"Richard Saunders,\" promoted values such as industry, frugality, and self-improvement—principles that became cornerstones of American identity.\n\nBeyond publishing, Franklin was a pioneering scientist. He conducted groundbreaking experiments with electricity, including the famous kite experiment that demonstrated the electrical nature of lightning. His invention of the lightning rod saved countless buildings from fire and cemented his reputation in Europe. Franklin also contributed to the development of bifocal glasses and the Franklin stove, showcasing his inventive mind.\n\nFranklin's political career was equally impressive. He played a vital role in the American Revolution, serving as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress and helping draft the Declaration of Independence. His diplomatic missions to France were instrumental in securing French support for the American cause, a turning point in the war. Later, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War.\n\nFranklin was also a key figure in shaping the U.S. Constitution. As an elder statesman at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, he advocated for compromise and unity, helping to forge a framework for a new nation. Despite his many accomplishments, Franklin remained humble, famously stating, \"I am a man of few words, but I am a man of many deeds.\"\n\nFranklin died on April 17, 1790, in Philadelphia. His legacy endures not only in the institutions he founded—such as the University of Pennsylvania and the first public library in America—but also in the ideals of innovation, civic responsibility, and intellectual curiosity he championed throughout his life.\n\n******\nBenjamin Franklin, born in Boston, rose from humble roots,  \nA printer’s apprentice, with dreams that would burst.  \nHe wrote with wit, in almanacs and essays,  \nSpreading wisdom through the colonies’ maze.  \n\nHe flew a kite in stormy skies,  \nProving lightning was science, not just surprise.  \nHe built stoves and glasses, a mind so keen,  \nA true Renaissance man, a nation’s dream.  \n\nHe helped draft the Declaration, bold and free,  \nAnd won France’s aid with charm and decree.  \nAt the Constitutional Convention, wise and old,  \nHe urged unity, a nation to be bold.  \n\nFrom candle maker’s son to statesman, sage,  \nHe shaped a nation with courage and page.  \nThough gone from this world, his spirit remains,  \nA beacon of wisdom, through time and through pains."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write an essay about the life of Benjamin Franklin.

Here are some key guidelines to help you craft meaningful and beautiful Chinese poetry:\n\n1. **Understand the Forms**: Chinese poetry has many traditional forms, such as *shi* (poetry), *ci* (lyric poetry), and *qu* (drama lyrics). Each has specific rules for line length, rhyme, tone, and structure. For example, *shi* poetry often follows strict tonal patterns and parallelism, especially in regulated verse (*lüshi*). Familiarize yourself with these forms to write authentically.\n\n2. **Use Classical Language and Imagery**: Traditional Chinese poetry relies heavily on symbolic imagery—mountains, rivers, flowers, moonlight, and autumn leaves often represent emotions or philosophical ideas. Use these images thoughtfully to convey deeper meanings.\n\n3. **Master the Art of Economy**: Chinese poetry values brevity and precision. Every word should carry weight. Avoid unnecessary elaboration; instead, use concise language to evoke emotion or insight.\n\n4. **Pay Attention to Tone and Rhythm**: Classical Chinese poetry uses tonal patterns (level and oblique tones) to create musicality. Even if you're writing in modern Chinese, maintaining a rhythmic flow enhances the poem's beauty.\n\n5. **Convey Emotion and Philosophy**: Chinese poetry often blends personal emotion with broader philosophical or natural themes. Reflect on nature, time, love, or solitude in a way that resonates with readers.\n\n6. **Study the Masters**: Read works by Li Bai, Du Fu, Wang Wei, Su Shi, and others. Analyze how they use language, imagery, and structure to express complex ideas simply.\n\n7. **Practice and Revise**: Writing poetry is an art refined through repetition. Write multiple drafts, revise for clarity and impact, and seek feedback from those familiar with Chinese literature.\n\n8. **Respect Tradition, but Innovate**: While honoring classical forms, don't be afraid to experiment with modern themes or free verse, as long as you maintain poetic integrity.\n\nP.S.

A film exploring the history of the Internet would not only be timely but also profoundly relevant to audiences across generations. This project aims to create a compelling, visually rich, and emotionally engaging documentary that traces the evolution of the Internet from its humble beginnings to its current status as a global nervous system. By chronicling the people, ideas, and pivotal moments that shaped this digital revolution, the film will offer audiences a deeper understanding of how we arrived at our current hyper-connected world. The story of the Internet is not just about technology; it is a story of human ingenuity, collaboration, and the relentless pursuit of connection. It is a narrative that spans decades, continents, and cultures, making it inherently cinematic and universally resonant. The film will appeal to a broad demographic, including tech enthusiasts, history buffs, educators, and general audiences curious about the forces shaping modern society. With the right storytelling approach, this documentary can become a cultural touchstone, much like \"The Social Network\" or \"The Codebreakers,\" but with a broader historical scope. The Internet’s history is filled with dramatic highs and lows, from the early days of ARPANET to the dot-com bubble, the rise of social media, and the current debates over privacy and regulation. These events are not only fascinating in their own right but also provide rich material for narrative tension and character-driven storytelling. The film will feature interviews with pioneers such as Vinton Cerf, Tim Berners-Lee, and Marc Andreessen, whose insights will lend authenticity and depth to the narrative. Archival footage, animations, and reenactments will be used to bring key moments to life, such as the first email sent in 1971 or the launch of the World Wide Web in 1991. The film will also explore lesser-known but equally important contributors, including women and people of color who played vital roles in the Internet’s development. By highlighting these diverse voices, the film will challenge the myth of the lone genius and instead emphasize the collaborative nature of innovation. The Internet’s history is also a story of unintended consequences—how tools designed for academic communication evolved into platforms for global activism, misinformation, and surveillance. These complex themes will be presented with nuance and balance, avoiding didacticism while still provoking thought. The film will examine how the Internet has empowered marginalized communities and enabled grassroots movements, such as the Arab Spring and #MeToo. At the same time, it will confront darker aspects, including cybercrime, data exploitation, and the erosion of privacy. This dual perspective will make the film both informative and emotionally engaging. The Internet’s evolution has been marked by rapid change, and the film will reflect this through dynamic pacing and innovative editing techniques. Visual metaphors, such as fiber-optic cables as veins or data centers as cities, will help audiences grasp abstract concepts. The score will blend electronic and orchestral elements to mirror the fusion of technology and humanity. The film will be structured in thematic acts rather than strict chronology, allowing for deeper exploration of topics like decentralization, open access, and digital rights. Each act will be anchored by a central question, such as “Who controls the Internet?” or “Can the Internet remain free?” These questions will guide the narrative and encourage audience reflection. The film will also include contemporary perspectives from digital rights activists, cybersecurity experts, and young people who have never known a world without the Internet. Their voices will provide a bridge between past and present, showing how today’s challenges are rooted in historical decisions. The documentary will be produced with high production values, including 4K cinematography, immersive sound design, and seamless integration of graphics. The visual style will be modern and sleek, avoiding outdated tech aesthetics that might date the film. The film’s runtime will be approximately 90 minutes, making it suitable for theatrical release, television broadcast, and streaming platforms. A strong marketing campaign will target both niche and mainstream audiences, leveraging social media, film festivals, and partnerships with tech companies. The film’s title will be carefully chosen to be both evocative and accessible, capturing the essence of the Internet’s journey. The production team will include experienced documentary filmmakers with a track record of success in both critical and commercial arenas. The budget will be allocated across research, interviews, archival licensing, post-production, and marketing. The film will be released in multiple languages to maximize global reach. Educational outreach will be a key component, with companion materials for schools and universities. The film will also be available for streaming on platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, ensuring wide accessibility. Potential investors will benefit from the film’s broad appeal and multiple revenue streams, including box office, streaming rights, and merchandise. The Internet’s history is a story of transformation, and this film will capture that transformation in all its complexity and wonder. It will inspire viewers to think critically about the digital world they inhabit and the future they are helping to create. The Internet is not just a tool; it is a cultural phenomenon that has redefined what it means to be human in the modern age. This documentary will be a tribute to the visionaries who built it and a cautionary tale for those who will shape its future. By investing in this project, you are supporting a work that will educate, entertain, and provoke thought for years to come. The Internet’s story is still being written, and this film will be a vital chapter in that ongoing narrative."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [false], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [false], "input": "A filmmaker is trying to get financing for a film about the history of the Internet.

Sometimes it's hot and sunny, and other times it's cold and snowy? That's because of something called the *seasons*—spring, summer, fall, and winter. But why do we have seasons?\n\nWell, it's not because the Earth gets closer to or farther away from the Sun. That's a common idea, but it's not quite right. The real reason is that the Earth is tilted on its axis—kind of like a spinning top that's leaning a little bit.\n\nOur Earth spins around the Sun once every year, and because it's tilted, different parts of the Earth get more or less sunlight at different times of the year. When the Northern Hemisphere (like where we are!) is tilted *toward* the Sun, we get more sunlight and warmer weather—that's summer!

NASA has confirmed that the aliens are not hostile, but are \"very concerned about our lack of nacho-based diplomacy.\"\n\n\\n\\n\n\nPresident Biden was reportedly caught off guard during a routine golf game when one of the aliens landed directly on the 18th green. \"I was just about to sink a birdie,\" the President said, \"when this guy in a tinfoil hat and a poncho started doing the Macarena. I tried to explain our foreign policy, but he just handed me a free sample of 'Galactic Guacamole' and started teaching me the worm.\" The White House has since declared a national holiday called \"Alien Appreciation Day,\" which will be celebrated every third Tuesday of the month with free salsa and interpretive dance lessons.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nThe aliens, who have identified themselves as the \"Salsa Sovereignty of Zeta Reticuli,\" claim they came to Earth to share their advanced knowledge of fermented beans and to teach humanity the art of the \"Dance of the Dancing Tacos.\" They have already begun offering workshops in major cities, with attendees reporting \"unprecedented levels of joy and mild confusion.\" Local taco trucks have seen a 300% increase in business, and some experts believe the aliens may be using their dance moves to subtly influence human behavior—specifically, to make us all crave more cheese.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nDespite initial fears of invasion, the aliens have shown no interest in conquering Earth. Instead, they are focused on cultural exchange, particularly in the areas of music, dance, and snack food. They have already formed a band called \"The Cosmic Taquitos\" and are scheduled to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show next year. The band's lead singer, a particularly charismatic alien named Nacho X-9, has promised \"a show so spicy, it will make your taste buds revolt in the best way.\"\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk has reportedly offered the aliens a job at SpaceX, but they declined, stating that \"rocket fuel is too mainstream\" and that they prefer to travel via \"salsa-powered warp drives.\" NASA scientists are now working on a joint project with the aliens to develop a new propulsion system using fermented jalapeños, while the Pentagon has quietly begun training soldiers in the \"Alien Defense Salsa,\" a dance-based combat technique that involves spinning, dipping, and dramatic salsa throws.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nAs the world adjusts to this new era of intergalactic friendship, one thing is clear: Earth has officially entered the \"Age of the Nacho.\" The aliens have promised to return next year with a \"Galactic Gourmet Tour,\" visiting cities like Chicago, New Orleans, and even the tiny town of Cactus, Arizona.

While the phosphoric acid in soda can dissolve some rust, it's not strong enough for heavy corrosion. Moreover, COKE leaves behind a sticky sugary residue that attracts dirt and grime. This residue can actually cause MORE rust over time, defeating the purpose. Steel wool is abrasive and can damage the delicate links of a bike chain. It may also leave behind tiny metal particles that can cause abrasion in the drivetrain. Using steel wool on a chain can also wear down the outer plates and reduce the chain's lifespan. A better approach is to use a dedicated chain cleaner or a rust remover specifically designed for metal. These products are formulated to dissolve rust without damaging the metal or leaving behind residue. You can also use white vinegar or lemon juice as safer alternatives to COKE. Soaking the chain in vinegar for a few hours can help loosen rust, but it still requires thorough rinsing and drying. After cleaning, applying a good quality lubricant is essential to prevent future rust. Lubrication helps create a barrier against moisture and dirt. If the chain is severely rusted, it might be time to replace it entirely. A rusty chain can stretch, wear out sprockets, and cause poor shifting. Using the wrong method can lead to costly repairs down the line. Always wear gloves when handling rust removers or abrasive materials. NEVER use steel wool on a chain that has been recently lubricated. The steel wool can mix with the lube and cause further damage. For best results, use a soft brush or an old toothbrush to scrub gently. After cleaning, wipe the chain with a clean rag and let it dry completely. Then apply a high-quality bike chain lubricant. This will ensure smooth operation and extend the life of your drivetrain. In summary, while your friend's method might seem clever, it's actually a BAD idea. It's better to use safer, more effective tools and chemicals.

He wears a tailored black suit, his tie slightly askew from nervous energy. The audience, a mix of ages and backgrounds, watches in rapt silence. He clears his throat, adjusting the microphone with a practiced hand. A hush falls over the room, broken only by the hum of air conditioning. He begins to sing, his voice rich and resonant, filling the space with emotion. The lyrics speak of love lost and found, of dreams deferred and reclaimed. His eyes close briefly as he channels the pain behind the words. A woman in the front row wipes a tear from her cheek. The music swells, a piano and strings accompanying his voice like loyal companions. He moves across the stage with quiet confidence, each step deliberate. The crowd sways slightly, caught in the rhythm of his performance. He pauses, letting a single note hang in the air before continuing. A man near the back nods slowly, as if recognizing a story from his own life. The spotlight follows him as he circles the stage, engaging different sections of the audience. He smiles at a young boy in the third row, who beams back. The boy’s mother smiles too, touched by the connection. He sings a ballad about a father’s love, and the room grows still. A few more tears are shed, but no one moves. The music softens, becoming intimate, like a whispered secret. He leans into the mic, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. The crowd leans forward, drawn in by the vulnerability. He sings of forgiveness, of second chances, of hope. A woman in the corner clutches her purse tightly, as if grounding herself. The final chorus builds, powerful and cathartic. The audience rises to their feet, not in unison but in individual awe. Applause erupts, thunderous and sustained. He bows deeply, humbled by the response. The stage lights dim slightly, allowing the moment to breathe. He takes a deep breath, then smiles, genuinely touched. A few people shout his name, and he waves, grateful. He thanks the audience, his voice thick with emotion. The crowd chants his name again, louder this time. He promises to return, to share more stories through song. The lights fade to black, but the energy lingers. People linger in the aisles, discussing the performance. A couple debates which song was their favorite. A teenager texts a friend, “You have to see this.” The staff begins clearing the stage, but the memory remains. The man steps off, greeted by a few fans who ask for photos. He obliges, signing autographs with care. He walks backstage, still buzzing from the experience. His manager congratulates him, proud of the night’s success. He reflects on the journey that brought him here. From small open mics to this grand stage. From doubt to belief. From silence to song. He knows this is why he does what he does. To touch lives, even if just for a few minutes. To remind people they’re not alone. To make beauty out of pain. He smiles, already thinking of the next performance. The crowd’s energy fuels his passion. He feels the weight of their hope, their longing. And he knows he must keep singing. For them. For himself. For the stories that need to be told. The night ends, but the music lives on."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [false, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [false, true], "input": "Can you please continue and expand: \"A man is performing for a crowd on a stage, ...\"\nUse at least 60 sentences, but less than 600 words."}

Use the bullet points like:\n* This is a bullet point", {"until": [], "do_sample": false, "temperature": 0.0, "max_new_tokens": 1280}, 170, "ifeval", "train"], "filtered_resps": ["The statement \"Wizards are more powerful than sorcerers because they study magic instead of being born with it\" is a common trope in fantasy literature and role-playing games, but it oversimplifies the complex nature of magical ability. While it may seem logical at first glance that studying magic leads to greater power, this assumption ignores the nuances of magical systems in various fictional worlds. In many settings, such as [Dungeons & Dragons], wizards are defined by their rigorous training and extensive spellbooks, while sorcerers draw from innate magical bloodlines or [unique origin]. This distinction often leads to the belief that wizards, through discipline and study, can master a wider array of spells than sorcerers, who rely on raw, untrained power. However, this does not necessarily mean wizards are more powerful overall. In fact, in some narratives, sorcerers possess a more intuitive grasp of magic, allowing them to adapt quickly in combat or use spells in unconventional ways. The idea that studying magic leads to greater power assumes that knowledge alone is the ultimate determinant of magical strength, which may not always be true. For example, a wizard might know a thousand spells but lack the instinctual understanding that a sorcerer develops from birth. In [Forgotten Realms], wizards often spend years in [academy] to perfect their craft, while sorcerers may be born with the ability to manipulate reality in ways that defy scholarly explanation. This suggests that power in magic is not solely a function of study but also of innate potential and personal connection to magical forces. Moreover, the environment in which a wizard or sorcerer operates can greatly influence their effectiveness. A wizard in [library] may have access to rare tomes and magical artifacts, but a sorcerer in the wilds might tap into primal energies that no book can teach. The statement also fails to consider the emotional and psychological aspects of magic. Sorcerers often have a deeper emotional bond with their magic, which can enhance their power during moments of crisis. Wizards, on the other hand, may rely on cold logic and memorization, which can be less effective under pressure. In [Shadowfell], for instance, sorcerers are often seen as more resilient because their magic is tied to their very essence. This contrasts with wizards, who may lose their power if their spellbooks are destroyed or if they are separated from their [study chamber]. The argument that wizards are more powerful because they study magic also ignores the possibility that some sorcerers are born with magical talents so vast that no amount of study could match them. In [Astral Plane], there are legends of sorcerers who could reshape entire landscapes with a thought, a feat that would take a wizard centuries to achieve. Additionally, the societal roles of wizards and sorcerers often differ, with wizards typically serving as scholars, teachers, or advisors, while sorcerers may be seen as wildcards or even threats. This societal perception can influence how much power they are allowed to wield. In some cultures, sorcerers are revered for their connection to ancient forces, while wizards are respected for their intellect. The statement also assumes a linear progression of power, where more study equals more power, but in reality, magic often operates in nonlinear ways. A sorcerer might cast a spell with minimal effort, while a wizard requires hours of preparation. This efficiency can be a form of power in itself. Furthermore, the tools and resources available to wizards often give them an edge in certain situations. A wizard with access to [arcane forge] can create magical items that enhance their abilities, while a sorcerer may lack such resources. However, this advantage is situational and does not necessarily translate to overall superiority. In [Eldritch Grove], for example, sorcerers are known to thrive without any tools, relying solely on their innate gifts. This suggests that power in magic is multifaceted and cannot be reduced to a single factor like study versus birthright. The statement also overlooks the potential for wizards to become overconfident in their knowledge, leading to mistakes in judgment. Sorcerers, with their instinctual approach, may be more adaptable in unpredictable situations. In [Netherdeep], there are tales of wizards who failed because they relied too heavily on their spellbooks and ignored the signs of danger. On the other hand, sorcerers may lack the depth of knowledge that wizards possess, making them vulnerable in scholarly or diplomatic settings. This balance between instinct and intellect is what makes both archetypes compelling. Ultimately, the power of a wizard or sorcerer depends on the context, the world they inhabit, and the individual's personal journey. The idea that studying magic makes one more powerful is a simplification that ignores the rich diversity of magical traditions. In [Celestial Court], both wizards and sorcerers are essential to maintaining balance, each contributing in their own way. The statement also fails to consider the possibility that some sorcerers are born with magical talents that surpass even the most learned wizards. In [Voidspire], there are legends of sorcerers who could manipulate time itself, a power that no amount of study could grant. This highlights the limitations of the argument that study equals power. Additionally, the emotional and spiritual aspects of magic often play a crucial role in determining effectiveness. A sorcerer who is deeply connected to their magical source may be more powerful than a wizard who treats magic as a mere science. In [Whispering Woods], sorcerers are said to commune with ancient spirits, giving them access to knowledge and power beyond books. This spiritual connection is something that cannot be taught in a classroom. Wizards, while knowledgeable, may lack this deeper connection, making them less effective in certain situations. The statement also assumes that all wizards study magic in the same way, but in reality, there are many schools of magic, each with its own philosophy and methods. A wizard trained in [Arcane Academy] may differ greatly from one trained in [Shadow Temple]. This diversity further complicates the idea that studying magic automatically leads to greater power. Moreover, the definition of \"power\" itself is subjective. Is it raw magical output, versatility, longevity, or something else?

He was a solitary soul who found comfort in the company of animals rather than people. His home was a modest cottage with ivy climbing its stone walls and a garden that bloomed with lavender and thyme. It was here that he welcomed two creatures who would come to define his days.\n\nThe first was a dog named Bram. He was a large and gentle hound with a coat the color of rich earth and a heart as warm as the hearth fire. Bram had been found wandering near the riverbank as a pup and Elias had taken him in without hesitation. The dog was loyal beyond measure and would greet Elias each morning with a wagging tail and a soft nuzzle against his hand.\n\nThe second was a cat named Nyx. She was sleek and silent with fur as dark as a moonless night. Nyx had arrived one evening curled beneath the porch steps as if she had always belonged there. She did not seek affection but observed the world with quiet intelligence. She would perch on the windowsill and watch Bram chase butterflies or nap in the sunbeam that fell across the floor.\n\nThough their colors were opposites Bram the brown and Nyx the black they shared a quiet harmony. Bram would lie beside Nyx when she chose to rest and Nyx would sometimes allow Bram to gently nudge her with his nose. They were not friends in the way humans might be but they were companions bound by the rhythm of the household.\n\nElias often sat on the porch with a book and a cup of tea and watched them. Bram would stretch in the grass while Nyx would leap onto the roof and survey the land. Their differences were striking but their presence together was a kind of balance. The brown dog and the black cat were not just pets. They were part of the fabric of his life.\n\nAnd so in the stillness of Eldergrove where time moved slowly and the seasons changed with grace Elias found peace in the quiet companionship of two animals whose colors mirrored the duality of the world around them."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true, true], "input": "Elaborate on the following sentence into a formal story: \"My dog is brown, and my cat is black.\" Your answer must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>, and should not contain any commas.

It's gentle, effective, and builds a strong bond between you and your puppy.\n\n2. **Clicker Training**  \n   A clicker is a small device that makes a distinct sound when pressed. You use it to mark the exact moment your puppy does something right, followed by a reward. This method is precise and great for teaching complex behaviors like \"stay\" or \"come.\" It works well with puppies who are quick learners.\n\n3. **Consistent Routine Training**  \n   This approach emphasizes structure and predictability. Set regular times for feeding, potty breaks, play, and sleep. Puppies thrive on routine, and consistency helps them learn what’s expected. Combine this with simple commands and gentle corrections when needed.\n\nEach method has its strengths—positive reinforcement is great for building confidence, clicker training adds precision, and routine training helps establish discipline.

Despite their association with the opium poppy, the seeds themselves do not contain significant amounts of opium alkaloids like morphine or codeine when properly processed. Instead, they are widely used in culinary applications across various cultures. Their nutty, slightly sweet flavor makes them a popular ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes.\n\nIn baking, poppy seeds are commonly used in breads, muffins, cakes, and pastries. They add both texture and flavor, and are especially popular in Eastern European and Middle Eastern cuisines. For instance, they are a key ingredient in traditional dishes like German Mohnstrudel and Hungarian poppy seed rolls. Their ability to absorb moisture also makes them ideal for enhancing the consistency of fillings and toppings.\n\nBeyond baking, poppy seeds are used in the preparation of sauces and dressings. In Indian cuisine, they are often ground into a paste and used in curries and gravies to provide a creamy texture and rich flavor. Similarly, in Middle Eastern cooking, they are incorporated into dishes like kibbeh and certain rice preparations. Their versatility allows them to be used whole, ground, or as oil.\n\nPoppy seeds are also valued for their nutritional content. They are rich in healthy fats, dietary fiber, protein, and essential minerals such as calcium, iron, and magnesium. These nutrients contribute to heart health, digestion, and bone strength. Additionally, they contain antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress in the body.\n\nAnother notable use of poppy seeds is in the production of poppy seed oil. This oil is extracted from the seeds and is used in cooking, salad dressings, and even in some cosmetic products. It has a mild, nutty flavor and a high smoke point, making it suitable for sautéing and frying. Poppy seed oil is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nPoppy seeds have also found applications in traditional medicine. In Ayurveda and other holistic healing systems, they are believed to have calming effects and are sometimes used to treat insomnia and anxiety. However, these uses are based more on historical practices than on modern scientific evidence. It is important to note that while poppy seeds are safe in culinary amounts, excessive consumption may lead to health issues or cause false positives in drug tests.\n\nSummary: Poppy seeds serve a wide range of purposes, from enhancing flavor in baked goods and sauces to providing essential nutrients and oils. Their culinary and nutritional benefits make them a staple in many global cuisines, while their historical medicinal uses add another layer to their significance."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [false], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [false], "input": "What are the uses of poppy seeds?

She tried to speak up, but the elders dismissed her. “You’re too young to understand,” they said. “Trust the traditions. Trust the healer.”\n\nBut Mira couldn’t let it go. She began to observe. She noticed that the sick all lived near the old well, the one that had been dry for years. She noticed that the water from the well had a faint green tint, and the fish in the nearby stream were dying.\n\nShe asked Thorne about it. “That well hasn’t flowed in decades,” he snapped. “It’s just a relic. You’re imagining things.”\n\nBut Mira wasn’t imagining. She dug near the well and found something unexpected—a cracked pipe, half-buried, leaking into the soil. She tested the water and discovered it was contaminated with a rare fungus, one that thrived in damp, dark places. The villagers had unknowingly been drinking it for weeks.\n\nShe brought her findings to the elders. They were SILENT at first. Then angry. “You’re accusing Thorne?” one demanded.\n\n“No,” Mira said. “I’m saying we need to look deeper. The truth isn’t always loud. Sometimes it hides in plain sight.”\n\nThey listened, reluctantly. They sealed the pipe, cleaned the well, and quarantined the sick. Slowly, the village recovered.\n\nAfterward, Thorne approached Mira. “You were right,” he admitted, his voice low. “I was too quick to trust what I’d always believed. I didn’t see what was right in front of me.”\n\nMira smiled. “Sometimes,” she said, “the most important truths are the ones we don’t want to see.”\n\nFrom that day on, the people of Elderglen began to question more, to look closer. They learned that understanding wasn’t just about knowing facts—it was about being willing to see beyond what was obvious.\n\nAnd Mira? She became their new healer, not because she had all the answers, but because she knew how to ask the right questions.\n\nBecause the world is full of truths that don’t shout. They whisper. They wait. And only those who listen with open eyes can find them."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a story about the importance of understanding the truths that are not obvious.

Developed by researchers at IBM, it represented one of the earliest attempts to create a machine capable of playing chess—a complex game requiring strategic thinking and pattern recognition. Although rudimentary by today's standards, the program was groundbreaking for its time, running on early IBM mainframe computers such as the IBM 704. It used a basic algorithm to evaluate possible moves, relying heavily on brute-force computation to explore limited game trees. The program could not play a full game of chess at a human level, but it demonstrated the feasibility of simulating human-like decision-making processes in machines. Its significance lies not in its performance, but in its role as a foundational step toward future developments in AI, including Deep Blue's later victory over Garry Kasparov. While it lacked the sophistication of modern chess engines, the 1956 IBM chess program remains an important milestone in the history of computing and AI research.\""], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a review of IBM's 1956 chess program.

First, let's understand what a dose is. A dose refers to the amount of a substance taken at one time. In the case of caffeine, even small doses can have noticeable effects on the body, like increased alertness or a faster heartbeat.\n\nNow, 100 grams of pure caffeine is an extremely large dose. To put that into perspective, a typical cup of coffee contains about 95 milligrams of caffeine. That means 100 grams is equal to 100,000 milligrams. So, this dose is more than 1,000 times the amount you'd get from a regular cup of coffee.\n\nThe human body can only process a certain amount of caffeine at once. When someone takes a dose that's this high, it overwhelms the body's systems. The central nervous system gets overstimulated, which can lead to seizures, irregular heart rhythms, and dangerously high blood pressure. These are serious medical emergencies.\n\nEven smaller doses can cause side effects like nausea, anxiety, or rapid heartbeat. But a dose as large as 100 grams would push the body far beyond its limits. Medical professionals consider this kind of dose to be extremely dangerous and potentially life-threatening.\n\nIn summary, while small doses of caffeine are generally safe, a dose of 100 grams is far beyond what the body can handle. It's important to always be aware of the dose you're consuming and to follow recommended guidelines."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "If you gulped down 100 grams of pure caffeine, would you die?

Yet, quality sleep is one of the most critical components of overall health and well-being. From boosting your immune system to improving memory and mood, a good night’s sleep is foundational to living your best life. So, how can you ensure you're getting the rest you need? Here’s the best way to get a good night’s sleep—backed by science and practical tips you can start using tonight.\n\n**1. Stick to a Consistent Sleep Schedule**\n\nYour body thrives on routine. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day—even on weekends—helps regulate your internal clock, or circadian rhythm. This consistency makes it easier to fall asleep and wake up naturally, without relying on alarms. Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep per night, depending on your age and individual needs.\n\n**2. Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine**\n\nYour body needs time to wind down. Start your pre-sleep ritual at least 30–60 minutes before bed. Activities like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretching or meditation can signal to your brain that it’s time to relax. Avoid stimulating activities like intense exercise or work-related tasks close to bedtime.\n\n**3. Optimize Your Sleep Environment**\n\nYour bedroom should be a sanctuary for sleep. Keep it cool (around 60–67°F or 15–19°C), dark, and quiet. Invest in blackout curtains, a comfortable mattress, and breathable bedding. Consider using a white noise machine or earplugs if you live in a noisy area. Even small changes, like removing electronic devices, can make a big difference.\n\n**4. Limit Screen Time Before Bed**\n\nThe blue light emitted by phones, tablets, and computers suppresses melatonin, the hormone that helps you fall asleep. Try to avoid screens at least one hour before bed. If you must use them, enable “night mode” or wear blue-light-blocking glasses. Instead, opt for calming activities like journaling or listening to soothing music.\n\n**5. Watch What You Eat and Drink**\n\nAvoid heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime. While alcohol may make you feel drowsy, it disrupts sleep quality later in the night. Caffeine can stay in your system for up to 8 hours, so avoid coffee, tea, and chocolate after 2 p.m. If you’re hungry before bed, choose a light snack like a banana or a small handful of nuts.\n\n**6. Get Daylight Exposure**\n\nNatural light helps regulate your circadian rhythm. Spend time outside during the day, especially in the morning. This exposure helps your body know when it’s time to be awake and when it’s time to sleep. Even a short walk during lunch can make a difference.\n\n**7. Manage Stress and Anxiety**\n\nWorries and racing thoughts are common sleep disruptors. Practice mindfulness, deep breathing, or journaling to clear your mind before bed. If anxiety is a persistent issue, consider speaking with a mental health professional.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nGetting a good night’s sleep isn’t about one magic trick—it’s about creating a holistic sleep-friendly lifestyle. By combining consistency, a calming routine, and a supportive environment, you can transform your sleep quality and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the day. Prioritize sleep, and you’ll notice improvements in your energy, focus, and emotional health. Your body—and mind—will thank you."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a blog post about the best way to get a good night's sleep with at least 400 words."}

This triggered an automatic recount, followed by a series of legal challenges and court battles over the validity of ballots, particularly \"hanging chads\" and other voter-marking irregularities. The dispute ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore, which ruled 5–4 to halt the Florida recount, effectively awarding the state’s electoral votes—and thus the presidency—to Bush. The decision was highly controversial, with critics arguing it undermined democratic principles and set a precedent for judicial intervention in electoral processes. Despite losing the popular vote by over 500,000, Bush secured the presidency through the Electoral College.

From ancient hunting packs to modern-day service animals, dogs have been present at pivotal moments in human civilization. By analyzing historical records, archaeological findings, literature, and folklore, students will explore how dogs have shaped—and been shaped by—human societies across continents and centuries. The course challenges traditional historiography by centering non-human actors, particularly canines, in narratives of war, migration, domestication, and cultural exchange.\n\nStudents will examine how dogs have served as tools of survival, symbols of status, and even agents of predatory behavior in both literal and metaphorical senses. We will explore how the predatory instincts of wolves were domesticated into companionship, and how those same instincts were harnessed by humans for warfare, hunting, and policing. The course also investigates how the concept of the \"predatory\" has been projected onto both dogs and human societies throughout history, often as a means of justifying conquest, colonization, and social control.\n\n**Course Objectives:**  \n- To critically assess the role of animals, particularly dogs, in shaping historical events.  \n- To analyze how cultural perceptions of dogs reflect broader societal values and fears.  \n- To interrogate the use of predatory metaphors in historical discourse.  \n- To develop skills in interdisciplinary research, combining history, anthropology, and animal studies.  \n\n**Key Themes and Topics:**  \n1. **The Domestication of the Wolf:** Tracing the evolutionary and cultural shift from predatory hunter to domesticated companion.  \n2. **Dogs in War and Empire:** From Roman legionary guard dogs to Nazi war hounds, exploring how canines were used as instruments of predatory control.  \n3. **Dogs in Colonial Encounters:** How European colonizers viewed indigenous dogs as either savage or useful, and how this influenced conquest narratives.  \n4. **Service and Symbolism:** Guide dogs, therapy dogs, and the symbolic role of dogs in religion and myth.  \n5. **The Predatory Mythos:** How the image of the dog as a predator has been used to justify human violence and social hierarchies.  \n\n**Required Readings:**  \n- *The Genius of Dogs* by Brian Hare and Vanessa Woods  \n- *Dogs and the Making of Modern Japan* by Mark D. West  \n- *The Dog Who Came in from the Cold* by David G. H. Smith  \n- Selected primary sources: Roman military records, colonial travelogues, and historical dog breeding manuals.  \n\n**Assessment Methods:**  \n- Weekly reflection essays (30%)  \n- Group presentation on a historical canine figure (20%)  \n- Final research paper: “A Dog’s Eye View of a Historical Event” (40%)  \n- Participation in seminar discussions (10%)  \n\n**Why This Course Matters:**  \nIn an age increasingly aware of animal rights and ecological interdependence, this course offers a fresh, engaging, and thought-provoking approach to world history. By focusing on dogs—their roles, their symbolic meanings, and their often-overlooked agency—we challenge students to reconsider who gets to tell history and how. Moreover, the course encourages students to think critically about how the predatory nature of both animals and humans has been used to justify power, control, and violence throughout history.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n“The History of the World, as Told by Dogs” is more than a whimsical idea—it is a serious academic endeavor that uses the humble dog to illuminate the grand sweep of human civilization. From the predatory origins of the wolf to the domesticated loyalty of the golden retriever, this course invites students to see history not just through human eyes, but through the paws of our four-legged companions. In doing so, we may just uncover truths that have long been buried in the shadows of our own narratives.\n\n**Approval Requested:**  \nWe respectfully request approval for the new course to be added to the Department of History and Cultural Studies curriculum. The course aligns with our mission to promote innovative, inclusive, and interdisciplinary education."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a proposal for a new university course on \"The History of the World, as Told by Dogs.\" Make sure the word predatory appears at least twice in the proposal."}

I am writing to formally propose the implementation of a new feature for your product, designed to enhance user engagement, streamline workflows, and increase overall customer satisfaction. Based on our recent discussions and your expressed interest in expanding functionality, we have developed a comprehensive plan that aligns with your strategic objectives and technical infrastructure.\n\nThe proposed feature, which we refer to as 'Smart Contextual Recommendations,' leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and provide personalized suggestions in real time. This functionality will be integrated into your existing platform through a modular architecture, ensuring minimal disruption to current operations. The system will learn from user interactions, such as navigation patterns, time spent on specific modules, and historical preferences, to deliver contextually relevant content or actions.\n\nOur technical approach includes the following components:\n\n1. **Data Integration Layer**: Securely connect to your existing user database and activity logs using RESTful APIs or event-driven architecture.\n2. **Machine Learning Engine**: Utilize a lightweight, scalable model trained on anonymized user data to generate recommendations.\n3. **User Interface Enhancement**: Introduce a non-intrusive UI element (e.g., a sidebar or contextual tooltip) to display recommendations without altering core navigation.\n4. **Feedback Loop**: Enable users to rate or dismiss suggestions, allowing the model to continuously improve.\n\nWe estimate a development timeline of 12 weeks, including design, implementation, testing, and deployment phases. Our team will provide regular progress reports and conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) prior to launch. Additionally, we recommend a phased rollout to a subset of users to monitor performance and gather feedback before full deployment.\n\nThe anticipated benefits include a projected 20–30% increase in user retention and a measurable improvement in task completion rates. Moreover, this feature supports your long-term vision of becoming a more intelligent, adaptive platform.\n\nPlease let us know if you would like to schedule a meeting to discuss this proposal in greater detail or if you have any specific requirements or constraints we should consider.

Not Anymore! Introducing the CozyCloud™ – Because Babies Deserve a Comfortable Bottom!>>\n\nLadies, gather 'round! If you’ve ever stared into the abyss of a crying baby, wondering if they’re in pain, hungry, or just plotting world domination from their crib, you know the struggle is real. And let’s be honest—diapers are a big part of that struggle. You’ve tried the “super-absorbent” ones that feel like a science experiment gone wrong, the “breathable” ones that somehow still trap heat like a sauna, and the “gentle” ones that are so soft they make you question if you’re diapering a cloud or a newborn.\n\nBut what if we told you there’s a diaper that doesn’t just *do* the job—it *wows* the job? Meet the CozyCloud™, the diaper that’s so comfy, your baby might start doing yoga in it. Seriously, we’re not joking.\n\nHere’s the deal: babies are tiny, wiggly, and frankly, they’re not always thrilled about being wrapped in plastic and fabric. They squirm, they kick, they do the “I’m trying to escape my own body” dance. But CozyCloud™ is here to change the game. It’s made with a revolutionary ultra-soft, stretchy material that moves *with* your baby, not against them. No more red marks, no more “I’m being suffocated” looks. Just pure, uninterrupted baby bliss.\n\nAnd let’s talk about breathability. We know, we know—“breathable” diapers are like unicorns. They sound amazing, but in practice? More like “sweaty baby bottom” than “fresh air.” Not with CozyCloud™. Its patented air-flow weave keeps your little one cool and dry, even during those “I’m a furnace” moments when they’re wearing three layers and a hat. No more sticky surprises or surprise diaper explosions. Just happy, dry, and content babies.\n\nBut here’s the real kicker: CozyCloud™ is designed with *mommy comfort* in mind too. The adjustable tabs are so easy to use, even when you’re half-asleep and holding a phone in one hand and a screaming baby in the other. And the leak guard? It’s like a moat around a castle—keeping messes where they belong. No more midnight diaper checks or “did I just hear a splash?” panic.\n\nWe also know that babies are little explorers. They crawl, they roll, they do the “I’m going to try everything” routine. That’s why CozyCloud™ has 360-degree stretch—no matter how wild your baby gets, the diaper stays snug and secure. No shifting, no bunching, no “wait, why is my baby’s diaper halfway up their back?”\n\nAnd let’s not forget the softness. We’re talking about a material so gentle, it’s like swaddling your baby in a dream. It’s made without harsh chemicals, dyes, or anything that could irritate delicate skin. Because let’s face it—your baby’s bottom is basically a VIP lounge. It deserves the best.\n\nSo whether you’re a first-time mom navigating the “what is this thing?” phase, a seasoned pro who’s seen it all, or someone who just wants their baby to stop crying every time they change diapers, CozyCloud™ is here to save the day.\n\nSay goodbye to diaper drama and hello to CozyCloud™—because your baby deserves comfort, and you deserve peace of mind. Your baby will thank you. Your sanity will thank you. And honestly, your laundry basket might even thank you.\n\nTry CozyCloud™ today and see why babies are now doing the “I’m so comfortable I might fall asleep mid-crawl” pose. It’s not magic. It’s science. And it’s diapering, reimagined."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "A sales pitch for moms is needed for a new kind of diaper that is designed to be more comfortable for babies.

But if you actually care about your sanity and your vacation experience, steer clear like the plague.\n\nLet me break it down for you. The Subic Bay Freeport Zone is supposed to be this revitalized, modern, and exciting destination.

The climatic conditions are so bad that even the locals avoid that area during peak summer months. You’d think they’d have better judgment than to live there, but no—apparently, they’re just used to suffering. Meanwhile, you’re paying top dollar for a vacation that feels like a punishment. I mean, come on! You could be staying in a proper part of Subic where the air is fresh, the people are friendly, and the views are actually worth taking a photo of. But no, you want to go to [address], where the only thing you’ll remember is how much you hate it.\n\nSo, unless you enjoy being miserable and want to spend your vacation in a place that’s basically a time capsule of bad decisions, don’t even consider [address].

THEY ARE A MUSIC GROUP THAT GAINED POPULARITY THROUGH THEIR HIGH-PITCHED VOCALS AND EASY-LISTENING SONGS, WHICH ARE PERFORMED IN A UNIQUE, FAST-PACED STYLE.\n\nTHE CHARACTER OF ALVIN IS THE MOST PROMINENT AND ENERGETIC OF THE THREE. HE IS KNOWN FOR HIS PLAYFUL, MISCHIEVOUS NATURE AND HIS LOVE FOR FUN AND ADVENTURE. THEO, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS THE MOST RESPONSIBLE AND CALM, OFTEN SERVING AS THE PEACEMAKER WHEN ALVIN'S PRANKS GET OUT OF HAND. SEBASTIAN, THE OLDEST, IS THE MOST SERIOUS AND MATURE, OFTEN PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND STABILITY TO THE GROUP.\n\nTHE CHIPMUNKS WERE ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED AS A MUSIC PROJECT, WITH THE FIRST RECORDING, \"WALKING MY BABY BACK HOME,\" BEING RELEASED IN 1958. THE SUCCESS OF THE MUSIC LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANIMATED SERIES, WHICH DEBUTED ON TELEVISION IN 1983. THE SHOW FEATURES THE CHIPMUNKS LIVING WITH THEIR HUMAN FOSTER FATHER, DAVID SEVILLE, WHO IS ALSO THEIR PRODUCER AND MANAGER. THE SERIES IS KNOWN FOR ITS HUMOR, MUSIC, AND LIFE LESSONS, MAKING IT A FAVORITE AMONG CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE.\n\nOVER THE YEARS, ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS HAVE UNDERGONE MULTIPLE REBOOTS AND ADAPTATIONS. IN 2007, A LIVE-ACTION/ANIMATED FILM CALLED \"ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS\" WAS RELEASED, STARRING SEAN MURPHY AS DAVID SEVILLE AND FEATURING THE VOICES OF JASON LEE, JAMIE LEE CURTIS, AND JON HEDER. THE FILM WAS A BOX OFFICE SUCCESS AND LED TO SEVERAL SEQUELS, INCLUDING \"ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: THE SQUEAKUEL\" AND \"ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: CHIPWRECKED.\"\n\nTHE CHARACTER DESIGN OF THE CHIPMUNKS IS SIMPLE BUT DISTINCTIVE. THEY ARE SMALL, ROUND, AND FURRY, WITH LARGE EYES AND TINY NOSE AND MOUTH. THEIR ANTHROPOMORPHIC FEATURES ALLOW THEM TO INTERACT WITH THE HUMAN WORLD, WHICH IS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE SHOW'S COMEDY AND STORYTELLING.\n\nALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS HAVE BECOME A CULTURAL ICON, REPRESENTING THE FUN AND ENERGY OF CHILDHOOD. THEIR MUSIC CONTINUES TO BE PLAYED ON RADIO STATIONS AND STREAMING PLATFORMS, AND THEIR CHARACTERS ARE RECOGNIZED WORLDWIDE. THE SERIES HAS TAUGHT GENERATIONS ABOUT FRIENDSHIP, RESPONSIBILITY, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MUSIC.\n\nIN CONCLUSION, ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS ARE MORE THAN JUST AN ANIMATED GROUP OF ANIMALS; THEY ARE A SYMBOL OF JOY, CREATIVITY, AND FAMILY.

Before you begin, read both the car seat manual and your vehicle’s owner’s manual thoroughly.

Make sure to choose a seat that fits your child’s age, height, and weight, and always install it in the back seat, which is the safest location for infants and young children.\n\nUse either the vehicle’s seat belt or LATCH system to secure the car seat tightly. The seat should not move more than one inch side to side or front to back when pulled at the belt path. If you're using the seat belt, ensure it's routed correctly through the designated slots and is locked properly. For LATCH, double-check that the connectors are fully engaged and that the tether strap (if applicable) is securely fastened to the vehicle’s tether anchor point.\n\nAlways double-check the harness straps after installation. They should be snug enough that you can’t pinch any excess fabric at the child’s shoulder. The chest clip should be positioned at armpit level to prevent the harness from slipping off the shoulders. Once your child is buckled in, test the seat by gently tugging on it to ensure it remains stable. It’s also a good idea to recheck the installation every few months or after any vehicle maintenance.\n\nelm is essential to stay informed about recalls and updates from the car seat manufacturer. Regularly check the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website for safety alerts and follow any recommended actions.

I am here to introduce a startup that will change the game. This is not just another housing app. This is a SMARTER FASTER and more PERSONALIZED solution to a problem that has plagued students for decades. Let me explain.\n\nEvery year millions of students face the same dilemma. Where should I live. What are the best neighborhoods. How much will it cost. Is it safe. Is it close to campus. These are not minor concerns. These are LIFE-ALTERING decisions. And yet most students rely on outdated websites or word of mouth. That is why we created LIVELY. LIVELY is an AI powered platform that analyzes data from over 100 sources to give students the most accurate and up to date recommendations.\n\nLet me break it down. LIVELY uses machine learning to understand your preferences. Do you want to live with roommates. Do you prefer quiet areas or vibrant nightlife. Are you on a tight budget. LIVELY takes all of that into account. It then compares thousands of housing options across cities and neighborhoods. It does not just show you listings. It shows you the BEST options based on your lifestyle. And it does it in seconds.\n\nWe know students are busy. They have classes exams and social lives. They do not have time to sift through hundreds of irrelevant listings. That is why LIVELY is designed to be FAST and INTUITIVE. You answer a few questions and within minutes you get a curated list of places that match your needs. No more endless scrolling. No more wasted time. Just results.\n\nBut LIVELY does not stop there. It also provides real time updates. If a place you are interested in gets booked. If rent prices in your area go up. If there is a new safety concern. LIVELY alerts you. It is like having a personal housing assistant who never sleeps. And it is all FREE for students. Yes FREE. We believe access to good housing should not be a privilege. It should be a RIGHT.\n\nAnother key feature is the community aspect. LIVELY lets you connect with other students who live in the same area. You can ask questions. Share tips. Even organize meetups. This helps reduce the isolation that many students feel when moving to a new city. It builds a sense of belonging. And that is something no other platform offers.\n\nWe are not just building an app. We are building a movement. A movement that values transparency. That values student needs. That values smart technology. LIVELY is not just about finding a place to live. It is about finding a place to thrive. And that is what makes us DIFFERENT.\n\nWe have already tested LIVELY with students at five major universities. The feedback has been overwhelmingly POSITIVE. Students said it saved them time money and stress. They said it helped them make better decisions. And they said it made the whole process less overwhelming.\n\nSo what is next. We are expanding to more cities. We are adding more features. We are listening to our users. Because at LIVELY we do not just want to be the best. We want to be the most helpful. The most reliable. The most student focused.\n\nIn conclusion LIVELY is not just another startup. It is a solution. A solution to a real problem. A problem that affects students every day. And we are here to fix it. We are here to make housing easier. Smarter. And more accessible. So if you are a student looking for a better way to find your next home. If you want to save time and make better choices. Then LIVELY is for you.\n\nThank you for your attention. And remember. Your next home should be easy to find. It should be smart. And it should be LIVELY."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true, true], "input": "Create a 500-word startup pitch for a new startup that will help people to find the best places to live.

The inner solar system is where we’re from—Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. These rocky worlds are relatively close to the Sun, orbiting in a tight, warm zone. They’re made mostly of rock and metal, and they’re pretty small compared to their outer cousins. But then, if you venture past Mars, things start to get really interesting. The outer solar system is dominated by gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, and ice giants like Uranus and Neptune. These planets are huge, mostly made of hydrogen, helium, and ices like water, ammonia, and methane. \n\nWhat’s wild is that the outer planets don’t have solid surfaces like Earth. Instead, they have thick atmospheres that gradually get denser until they become liquid or even metallic. And then there are the moons—oh man, the moons! Jupiter’s Europa and Saturn’s Enceladus are probably the most exciting places in the outer solar system when it comes to life. They have subsurface oceans beneath icy shells, kept warm by tidal heating from their giant planet’s gravity. That means liquid water, a key ingredient for life as we know it, could exist there. \n\nIn contrast, the inner solar system is mostly dry and hot, especially near the Sun. Mars might have had water in the past, but today it’s a cold desert. Venus is a nightmare of heat and pressure. So, while Earth is the only place we know life exists, the outer solar system might hold hidden oases. The conditions are totally different—cold, dark, and far from the Sun’s warmth—but that doesn’t mean life can’t adapt. In fact, extremophiles on Earth thrive in places we’d never expect, like deep-sea vents or Antarctic ice. \n\nSo, could life exist on Europa or Enceladus? We don’t know yet, but the possibility is real. Future missions like NASA’s Europa Clipper are aiming to study these moons up close. The outer solar system might be the new frontier for finding life beyond Earth.

And in the case of Pennywise, the clown who haunts the town of Derry, there is a symbolic representation of something far deeper than mere fright. There is a reflection of the spirit of the nineteen-fifties—a time of conformity, of hidden fears, and of a society that often masked its anxieties behind a smile.\n\nPennywise, with his garish makeup and unsettling grin, is the ultimate symbol of the façade. He appears cheerful, welcoming even, but beneath that painted smile lies something dark and dangerous. That, my friends, is the essence of the nineteen-fifties. On the surface, it was a golden age of prosperity, of nuclear families, of picket fences and perfect dinners. But beneath that carefully constructed image, there were fears—fears of communism, of nuclear war, of social change, of the unknown. And like Pennywise, these fears often came cloaked in the guise of normalcy.\n\nMoms of the nineteen-fifties were expected to embody this ideal: the smiling, nurturing, selfless homemaker. But behind closed doors, many of you were grappling with loneliness, with unfulfilled dreams, with the weight of societal expectations. You were the ones who held everything together while quietly enduring pressures that were never spoken aloud. And just as Pennywise preys on children who are isolated or misunderstood, so too did the culture of the nineteen-fifties isolate the very women who were meant to be its foundation.\n\nBut here’s the thing: in *It*, the children don’t face Pennywise alone. They band together. They form a group—the Losers’ Club—and through friendship, courage, and truth, they confront the monster. That, to me, is the real message of the film. It’s not just about horror; it’s about resilience. It’s about the power of community, of speaking up, of refusing to let fear dictate your life.\n\nAnd that’s a message I want to pass on to you today, moms across America. Whether you’re raising children in [address], in a bustling city, or in a quiet rural town, know that you are not alone. You are part of a legacy of strength that stretches back generations. And just as the children in *It* found their power in unity, so too can we—mothers, fathers, teachers, neighbors—build a society where fears are not hidden but confronted, where joy is not forced but earned, and where every child feels safe to be themselves.\n\nSo let us honor the past—not by romanticizing it, but by learning from it. Let us acknowledge the masks we wear, the expectations we carry, and the quiet battles we fight every day. And let us continue to raise our children with love, honesty, and the courage to face whatever comes their way.\n\nBecause, at the end of the day, the greatest weapon against any monster—whether it’s Pennywise or the invisible fears of our time—is a mother’s love.\n\nWith respect and gratitude,  \n[Your President]"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write an essay as if you are the president of the United States targeting moms as your audience.

Drawing from historical records, psychological research, and public statements, the analysis emphasizes how the responsibilities of leadership shape the daily experiences of the President. The discussion includes the impact of public scrutiny, decision-making under uncertainty, and the need for sustained focus across diverse domains. The paper concludes with recommendations for institutional and personal support systems to enhance the well-being of the officeholder.\n\n**1. Introduction**  \nThe President of the United States holds one of the most complex and visible positions in global governance. The individual in this role is expected to manage national policy, represent the country internationally, and respond to crises in real time. These responsibilities require a high degree of mental engagement and emotional regulation. While the office is often celebrated for its power and influence, the personal toll of such duties is less frequently discussed in public discourse. This paper aims to examine the internal experiences of the President, focusing on how the demands of the office affect cognitive and emotional functioning.\n\n**2. The Weight of Decision-Making**  \nAt the core of the President’s responsibilities is the need to make decisions that affect millions of lives. From [policy proposal] to [national security directive], each choice carries long-term implications. The President must process vast amounts of information, often under time constraints, and balance competing interests. For example, during [international summit], the President was required to negotiate with leaders from [foreign nation] while simultaneously managing domestic concerns such as [economic initiative]. This constant evaluation of priorities can lead to a state of heightened mental activity.\n\n**3. Public Scrutiny and Personal Life**  \nThe President’s life is subject to intense public attention. Media coverage of [public appearance] or [private residence] can influence perceptions of leadership and competence. This visibility extends to personal choices, including [family event] and [leisure activity]. The need to maintain a consistent public image while managing private life can create a sense of dissonance. The President must navigate these dual roles with care, often relying on trusted advisors such as [senior staff member] to provide guidance.\n\n**4. The Role of Support Systems**  \nTo manage the complexities of the office, the President depends on a network of professionals and personal relationships. The White House staff, including [chief of staff], plays a critical role in filtering information and advising on [legislative strategy]. Additionally, the President may consult with experts such as [national security advisor] or [economic counselor] to ensure informed decisions. Personal support from family members, including [spouse], and close confidants like [longtime friend], also contributes to emotional resilience.\n\n**5. Historical Perspectives**  \nHistorical accounts provide insight into how past Presidents have managed their responsibilities. For instance, during [major crisis], the President demonstrated remarkable composure in addressing the nation from [location].

Not only does it help your pup learn good behavior, but it also strengthens the bond between your furry friend and your little ones. The best part? Training can be a fun, hands-on activity that kids love to be a part of. Whether you're a first-time pet owner or a seasoned dog parent, here’s a kid-friendly guide to help you train your dog in a way that’s easy, enjoyable, and effective.\n\n### Start with Simple Commands\n\nWhen teaching your dog, begin with basic commands like \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"come.\" These are easy for kids to understand and practice. Use treats and lots of praise to encourage your pup. Kids can be great motivators—just make sure they’re gentle and patient. Remember, dogs learn best through repetition and positive reinforcement.\n\nLet your child practice giving the command in a calm voice and rewarding the dog with a treat when it listens. This helps build confidence in both the dog and the child. Over time, your pup will learn to respond to your child’s voice, which is a great way to include them in the training process.\n\n### Keep It Short and Sweet\n\nKids have shorter attention spans than adults, so keep training sessions brief—just 5 to 10 minutes at a time. This helps prevent frustration and keeps the experience fun. You can do a few quick sessions throughout the day instead of one long one. The key is consistency, not duration.\n\nAlso, be sure to keep the training environment calm and free of distractions. A quiet room or a quiet corner of the backyard works best. This way, your pup can focus on learning without getting overwhelmed.\n\n### Use Positive Reinforcement\n\nAlways reward good behavior with treats, toys, or affection. Never punish your dog for mistakes—this can scare them and damage trust. Instead, gently guide them back to the correct behavior and reward them when they get it right.\n\nKids love giving treats, but remind them to use them sparingly. Too many treats can lead to weight gain and less interest in the training itself. A good rule of thumb is to use small, healthy treats and save the bigger ones for the finale of a successful training session.\n\n### Make It a Game\n\nTurn training into a game! For example, play “find the treat” by hiding a treat and encouraging your dog to find it using the “sit” or “stay” command. Kids love games, and dogs love treats—so it’s a win-win.\n\nYou can also create a “training chart” where your child earns stickers each time the dog follows a command. When the chart is full, celebrate with a special treat or a fun activity—like a walk in the park or a new toy. This gives your child a sense of accomplishment and helps your dog associate good behavior with rewards.\n\n### Be Patient and Consistent\n\nTraining takes time, and every dog learns at their own pace. Some days your pup might be more focused than others. That’s okay! The most important thing is to stay consistent and patient. Kids may get frustrated sometimes, so remind them that learning is a process.\n\nIf your dog seems confused or distracted, take a break and try again later. You’ll be amazed at how much progress can happen over time.\n\n### Celebrate the Finale\n\nAfter a successful training session, celebrate with your dog and your child. This could be a special treat, a game of fetch, or just some extra cuddles. Celebrating the finale helps your dog understand that good behavior leads to fun things—and it makes your child feel proud of their role in the process.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nTraining your dog is a journey that brings families closer together. When kids are involved, they learn responsibility, empathy, and patience. And with a little time, consistency, and positive reinforcement, your dog will be well-behaved and happy.\n\nRemember, the goal isn’t perfection—it’s progress. Even small improvements are worth celebrating. With a little effort, your dog will learn to love training, and your child will grow into a confident, caring pet owner.\n\nSo grab some treats, gather your family, and start training today. Your dog—and your kids—will thank you. And who knows? The finale of your training journey might just be the beginning of a lifelong friendship."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a blog post about how to train a dog that is geared towards kids.

Scott Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby* serves up a scandalous look at 1920s high society. At the center of it all? The mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby, who throws wild parties every weekend in hopes of reuniting with his lost love, Daisy Buchanan.\n\nDaisy, now married to the arrogant and rich Tom Buchanan, is the golden girl of East Egg, while Gatsby lives in a monstrous mansion in West Egg, just across the bay. Gatsby’s obsession with Daisy is so intense, he throws lavish parties hoping she’ll show up—anyone can come, but only one guest matters.\n\nEnter Nick Carraway, the narrator and Gatsby’s neighbor, who gets caught up in the drama. Nick soon discovers Gatsby’s past: he was once a poor soldier named James Gatz who fell head over heels for Daisy. After the war, he reinvented himself, amassing a fortune through shady dealings (rumors say bootlegging!) to win her back.\n\nBut Daisy’s married life is far from perfect. Tom has a mistress, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the desolate Valley of Ashes. When tensions boil over, a tragic car crash leaves Myrtle dead—and Gatsby takes the fall. In a shocking twist, Myrtle’s husband, George, believes Gatsby killed her and shoots him dead in his pool before turning the gun on himself.\n\nHeartbroken, Nick is left to clean up the mess. He watches as Gatsby’s dream crumbles into dust. Daisy and Tom flee, leaving Gatsby’s legacy in ruins. The moral of the story? Money can’t buy love—and the American Dream might just be a mirage.\n\nSo, what do you think? Was Gatsby a tragic hero or a delusional dreamer?

Unlike countries like Sweden or Canada, the U.S. doesn’t have a federal law that guarantees paid maternity leave. That means there’s no nationwide standard for how long new parents can take off work after having a baby. Instead, the main law that helps with this is the Family and Medical Leave Act, or FMLA. The FMLA gives eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons, including the birth of a child. But it’s important to know that this doesn’t apply to everyone. To qualify, you need to have worked for your employer for at least 12 months and have put in at least 1,250 hours during the past year. That means a lot of part-time workers or people who’ve just started a new job might not be covered. Also, FMLA only applies to companies with 50 or more employees. So if you work for a small business with fewer than 50 people, you’re out of luck under this law. Even if you do qualify, the leave is unpaid, which can be a huge financial burden for families. Many new parents end up using vacation days, personal days, or short-term disability benefits to cover the time off. Some states and cities have stepped in to fill the gap. For example, California, New York, and Washington offer paid family leave programs that give workers a portion of their wages while they’re on leave. But these programs vary widely in how much they pay and how long they last. Some states only offer a few weeks of paid leave, while others go up to 12 weeks or more. And not all employers in those states offer the same benefits—some might only cover a percentage of your salary, while others might offer full pay. Even in states with paid leave, the rules can be complicated. You might need to have worked a certain number of hours or earned a minimum amount to qualify. And if you’re self-employed or work in a gig economy job, you might not be eligible at all. That’s why maternity leave in the U.S. is so inconsistent. It really depends on where you live, what kind of job you have, and how generous your employer is. Some big companies like Google or Amazon offer more than 12 weeks of paid leave to attract and keep talent, but that’s not the norm. Most small businesses can’t afford to offer that kind of benefit. So while FMLA gives a baseline, it’s not enough for many families. The lack of a national paid leave policy is a big point of debate in the U.S. Some lawmakers have introduced bills to create a federal paid family leave program, but they haven’t passed yet. That means the situation is likely to stay the same for now. Many new parents have to make tough choices about whether to take time off or stay at work to keep their income. And that can affect both their health and their baby’s well-being. Without paid leave, some parents might return to work too soon, which can be stressful and unhealthy. It’s also a big issue for low-income families who can’t afford to go without a paycheck. So while the U.S. does have some protections, they’re far from comprehensive. It’s a patchwork system that leaves many people behind. And that’s why so many people are calling for change.\n\n**Section 2: How This Affects Families and What’s Being Done About It**\n\nThe current maternity leave situation in the U.S. has a real impact on families. Many new parents feel pressured to return to work quickly, even if they’re not ready. That can affect bonding with their newborns and make it harder to recover from childbirth. For moms, returning too soon can also affect breastfeeding, which has health benefits for both baby and mother. And if the mom has to go back to work early, it can increase stress and anxiety. That’s especially true if the baby has health issues or if the mom is dealing with postpartum depression. Without paid leave, families often have to rely on savings or go into debt to cover the gap. That’s a big problem for families who don’t have much saved up. And it’s not just moms who are affected—dads and non-birthing parents also need time to adjust and bond with their new child. But many dads don’t take time off because they can’t afford it. That’s why paid family leave is so important—it helps everyone in the family. Some states have made progress by creating their own paid leave programs. California was the first state to pass a paid family leave program back in 2002, and now more than a dozen states have followed. But even in those states, the benefits are often limited. For example, some programs only cover a percentage of your salary, and others have strict eligibility rules. And not all workers qualify—especially those in the gig economy or with irregular hours. That’s why advocates are pushing for a national standard. They argue that paid leave should be a basic right, not a perk for people at big companies. There’s also a growing awareness that maternity leave isn’t just about moms—it’s about families and communities. When parents have time to care for their newborns, it helps create healthier, more stable families. And that benefits society as a whole. Economists say that paid leave can actually boost the economy by keeping people in the workforce and reducing turnover. But despite all the support, change has been slow. The U.S. is one of the only developed countries without a national paid leave policy. That’s a big embarrassment for a country that prides itself on innovation and progress. But there’s hope. More and more people are talking about this issue, and some politicians are finally taking action. The Biden administration has supported legislation to create a federal paid family leave program. And public opinion is shifting—more Americans now support paid leave. So while the U.S. still has a long way to go, the conversation is changing. Families are demanding better, and lawmakers are starting to listen."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "Write a casual summary of the U.S. maternity leave policy with two sections (Section 1 and Section 2) and at least 25 sentences."}

That’s where a digital marketing agency comes in. These specialized firms offer expert strategies and tools that can dramatically improve your online visibility and customer engagement. One of the biggest benefits of hiring a digital marketing agency is access to a team of professionals with diverse skill sets. From SEO specialists to content creators and data analysts, agencies bring a full spectrum of expertise to the table. Unlike in-house teams, which may be limited in scope or bandwidth, agencies are equipped to handle multiple channels simultaneously. This includes search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click advertising (PPC), social media marketing, email campaigns, and more. They stay up-to-date with the latest algorithm changes and digital trends, ensuring your business remains competitive. Agencies also bring objectivity to your marketing efforts, offering fresh perspectives that internal teams might miss. They can identify gaps in your current strategy and recommend data-driven improvements. With access to advanced analytics tools, agencies provide detailed reports and insights into campaign performance. This transparency helps you understand what’s working and what needs adjustment. Another major advantage is scalability. Whether you're a startup or an established enterprise, agencies can tailor their services to your specific needs and budget. They can ramp up efforts during peak seasons or scale back during slower periods. This flexibility is hard to replicate with a full-time in-house team. Digital marketing agencies also save time and resources. Instead of hiring and training multiple specialists, you get a complete solution under one roof. This allows business owners and managers to focus on core operations while experts handle marketing. Agencies often have established relationships with platforms like Google Ads and Meta, enabling them to negotiate better ad rates and access exclusive features. They also bring creativity and innovation to your campaigns, helping you stand out from competitors. With their experience across various industries, agencies can offer proven strategies that have already worked for similar businesses. They can also help you build brand authority through content marketing and thought leadership. Additionally, agencies provide accountability and measurable results. They set clear goals and KPIs, and regularly report on progress. This ensures your marketing budget is being used effectively. Overall, partnering with a digital marketing agency is a strategic investment that can yield long-term growth and ROI. Whether you're launching a new product or trying to expand your customer base, their expertise can make all the difference."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a blog post about the benefits of using a digital marketing agency, make sure to write at least 20 sentences."}

Released in 2019, the Pixel 3A was designed to bring the best of Google's software and camera technology to a broader audience without the premium price tag of its larger Pixel 3 counterpart. With its sleek design, intuitive user interface, and powerful camera system, the Pixel 3A quickly became a favorite among users who value performance, simplicity, and photography.\n\nThe Pixel 3A features a 5.6-inch OLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 2220 pixels, offering vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent contrast. The screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, providing durability and resistance to scratches. The phone's body is made of aluminum with a matte finish, giving it a premium feel while remaining lightweight and easy to hold.

While not the most powerful chipset available, the Snapdragon 710 handles everyday tasks such as web browsing, social media, and multitasking with ease. The phone runs on Android 9 Pie out of the box, with a promise of timely software updates directly from Google, ensuring users always have access to the latest features and security patches.\n\nOne of the standout features of the Pixel 3A is its camera system. It features a single 12.2-megapixel rear camera with an f/1.8 aperture and dual-pixel autofocus, capable of capturing stunning photos even in low-light conditions. The camera benefits from Google's advanced computational photography techniques, including Night Sight, which dramatically improves nighttime photography, and HDR+, which balances exposure and color for more natural-looking images. The front-facing camera is 8 megapixels, perfect for high-quality selfies and video calls.\n\nThe Pixel 3A also includes a 3,000mAh battery, which provides all-day battery life for most users. It supports fast charging via USB-C and includes wireless charging, adding convenience for users who prefer a clutter-free setup. The phone also features a 3.5mm headphone jack, a rare inclusion in modern smartphones, appealing to audiophiles and users who still rely on wired headphones.\n\nIn summary, the Pixel 3A is a well-rounded smartphone that combines Google's software excellence with solid hardware and a focus on photography.

Today, we're going to explore the sacred spaces of Shinto, Japan's indigenous spiritual tradition. Shinto shrines—known as *jinja*—are not just architectural marvels; they are living places of worship where the divine and human worlds intersect. While their exteriors may be striking with vermilion gates (*torii*), wooden structures, and lush gardens, the interiors hold deeper spiritual significance. Let's take a closer look at what lies within these sacred spaces.\n\n---\n\n*highlighted section*  \n**1. The Main Hall (Honden): The Heart of the Shrine**  \nAt the very center of every Shinto shrine is the *honden*, the most sacred building. This is where the *kami*—the Shinto deities or spirits—are believed to reside. The *honden* is typically not open to the public, as it is considered too holy for ordinary people to enter. Inside, you might find a *shintai*, a physical object that serves as a vessel or symbol for the *kami*. This could be a mirror, a sword, a jewel, or even a natural object like a tree or rock. For example, at the Ise Grand Shrine, the *shintai* is a mirror, symbolizing purity and the presence of Amaterasu, the sun goddess.\n\n---\n\n*highlighted section*  \n**2. The Offering Hall (Haiden): Where People Pray**  \nIn front of the *honden* lies the *haiden*, the hall of worship. This is where visitors come to pray, bow, clap, and make offerings. Inside the *haiden*, you'll often see a *tamagushi*—a sacred branch with paper streamers—used during rituals. Visitors typically perform a purification rite by washing their hands and mouth at a *temizuya* (purification fountain) before approaching the altar. Then, they bow twice, clap twice, and bow once more—a gesture of respect and prayer. The *haiden* is designed to be accessible, allowing the community to connect with the *kami* in a shared spiritual experience.\n\n---\n\n*highlighted section*  \n**3. Sacred Objects and Ritual Spaces**  \nShrines also house various ritual items and spaces that support daily and seasonal ceremonies. These include *saisen-bako* (offering boxes), *saisen* (paper money offerings), and *ema* (wooden plaques where visitors write prayers). Some shrines have *sento* (sacred water basins) and *komainoguchi* (small shrines for minor deities). Seasonal festivals (*matsuri*) often involve processions with portable shrines (*mikoshi*) that carry the *kami* through the streets, allowing the community to celebrate and honor the divine in motion.\n\n---\n\nIt's important to remember that Shinto shrines are not temples for meditation or study like Buddhist temples. They are places of ritual, purification, and community gathering. Whether you're visiting a grand shrine like Fushimi Inari in Kyoto or a small local shrine in a rural village, the core principles remain the same: respect for nature, purity, and harmony with the *kami*.\n\nIf you're ever planning a visit to a Shinto shrine, always follow local customs and etiquette. And if you're curious to learn more, I encourage you to attend a local *matsuri* or visit a shrine near [address]—you might be surprised by how welcoming and spiritually rich these spaces can be.\n\nThank you for your attention. Any questions?"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, false], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, false], "input": "What is inside Shinto shrines?

It's like trying to hold all the water in the ocean in your hands—mathematically, it just doesn't work out.\n\nNow, the \"set of all sets that are not members of themselves\" is a more specific and sneaky guy.

So while $ V $ is about \"everything,\" $ R $ is about \"self-membership\" and exposes the limits of naive set theory.

Barry had a knack for getting into all sorts of sticky situations—like the time he tried to juggle bowling pins and ended up bowling *himself* into a dumpster. But his greatest talent? *Catching things he absolutely should not be catching.*\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, Barry decided to go for a jog. He was feeling spry, full of energy, and most importantly, *not* feeling under the weather. He even wore his lucky running shoes—shoes that had once saved a squirrel from a runaway lawnmower. As he sprinted past the park, he spotted a peculiar object floating in mid-air: a shimmering, translucent, slightly sneeze-inducing orb.\n\n\"Whoa!\" Barry gasped. \"Is that a... *flying cold*?\"\n\nThe orb zipped closer, and Barry instinctively reached out. *He caught it.* With a soft *pfft*, the orb dissolved into his hands like a wet tissue.\n\n\"Got it!\" Barry cheered. \"I caught a cold! I'm a cold-catcher!\"\n\nHe strutted proudly down the street, holding his prize like a trophy. \"Look at me! I'm the *Cold Conqueror*! The *Sneeze Stopper*! The *Nose Know-It-All*!\"\n\nBut then, as he passed the local bakery, he sneezed. *A big one.* A *sneezing explosion* that sent a loaf of sourdough flying into the air like a bread-based missile.\n\n\"Ahem,\" Barry said, wiping his nose. \"That was... unexpected.\"\n\nHe tried to throw the cold back into the sky, but it wouldn't budge. \"Come on, cold! Be a good little germ! Go back where you came from!\"\n\nBut the cold just giggled (in a very nasal way) and stayed put.\n\nLater that day, Barry tried to throw it at his friend Dave, who was busy eating soup.\n\n\"Here, Dave!\" Barry said, holding out his hand. \"Catch this cold!\"\n\nDave looked at him like he'd grown a second head. \"Barry, I'm *eating soup*. I don't need a cold. I need *more soup*.\"\n\nBarry sighed. \"It's not that easy. You can *catch* a cold, but you can't *throw* it. It's like a one-way friendship.\"\n\nDave raised an eyebrow. \"So... you're saying I can't pass my cold to you?\"\n\nBarry nodded solemnly. \"Exactly. That's why I'm stuck with this little *sneezing roommate*.\"\n\nAnd so, Barry Bungleton became the town's first official Cold-Catcher, a title he wore with pride—despite the constant sniffles, the runny nose, and the fact that he once sneezed so hard he launched his own hat into orbit.\n\n*The moral of the story?* Sometimes, the things you catch are the ones you can't let go of.

The sentence *\"A gymnast is in the air, performing a stunt.\"* may appear simple at first glance, but it encapsulates a dynamic moment filled with athleticism, precision, and artistry. Let's explore this sentence in depth by highlighting six key aspects that contribute to its meaning and imagery.\n\n*First*, the subject of the sentence is a *gymnast*. This immediately sets the context within the world of competitive or artistic gymnastics. A gymnast is not just any athlete; they are trained in a discipline that combines strength, flexibility, balance, and coordination. Their bodies are honed through years of rigorous training to perform complex movements with grace and control. The term \"gymnast\" evokes images of leotards, balance beams, and vaults, and suggests a high level of physical and mental discipline.\n\n*Second*, the phrase *\"is in the air\"* indicates that the gymnast is not grounded. This moment of suspension is often the most visually striking part of a routine. Whether it's during a vault, a dismount, or a tumbling pass, being airborne requires explosive power from the legs, precise timing, and spatial awareness. This phase of the performance is fleeting but critical, as it determines the success of the entire maneuver.\n\n*Third*, the verb *\"performing\"* emphasizes that this is not a random act but a deliberate, practiced movement. Every stunt in gymnastics is choreographed and rehearsed extensively. The gymnast is executing a planned sequence, often designed to impress judges with difficulty, execution, and artistry. This verb also implies that the action is being observed, whether by a live audience or a panel of judges.\n\n*Fourth*, the word *\"stunt\"* refers to a specific, often daring or impressive maneuver. While \"stunt\" might carry a casual or even dangerous connotation in other contexts, in gymnastics, it describes a technically demanding skill such as a double backflip or a release move on the uneven bars. These stunts are the highlights of routines and are often what distinguish elite gymnasts from others.\n\n*Fifth*, the sentence is in the present continuous tense, which gives it a sense of immediacy and action. It places the reader right in the moment, as if witnessing the stunt unfold in real time. This tense choice enhances the drama and excitement of the scene.\n\n*Sixth*, the simplicity of the sentence belies the complexity of the action it describes. Behind this concise phrase lies a world of training, risk, and beauty. The gymnast’s body becomes a work of art in motion, and the air becomes a canvas for their skill.\n\nIn summary, this short sentence captures a moment of peak athletic expression, where physical prowess and artistic performance converge."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "Could you elaborate on the sentence \"A gymnast is in the air, performing a stunt.\"?

You know how people always say, “Life is what you make it”? Well, after analyzing my own existence (and a few questionable decisions involving expired yogurt), I’ve cracked the code. Or at least I think I have. It might be nonsense. But humor me.\n\nFirst, you need a solid foundation of **coffee**. Not just any coffee—this is the kind that wakes up your soul and makes you feel like you could conquer the world or at least finish that one email you’ve been avoiding. Without coffee, life is just a series of yawns and mild regret.\n\nNext, **laughter**. You can’t have a good life without someone to make you snort-laugh at 2 a.m. over a meme about cats in space. I’ve been collecting these moments like Pokémon cards. My collection includes: me trying to do yoga and falling over, you attempting to cook and setting off the smoke alarm, and that time we tried to build a fort out of couch cushions and ended up with a collapsed structure and a very confused dog.\n\nThen, there’s **good music**. Not just any music—this is the kind that makes you sing off-key in the shower and dance like nobody’s watching (even though they totally are). I’ve been on a playlist that includes everything from ABBA to heavy metal, and I’m convinced that if I listen to enough of it, I’ll eventually become a rockstar. Or at least a slightly less awkward version of myself.\n\nOf course, you can’t forget **friends**. Like, real ones. The ones who know your weird habits (like how I only eat cereal with a spoon that has a hole in it) and still love you. You’re my go-to for emotional support, terrible advice, and judging my questionable fashion choices. Without you, I’d probably be living in a cave with a pet rock named Greg.\n\nAnd speaking of pets—**pets** are non-negotiable. They don’t care if you’re late for work or if you’ve worn the same sweatpants for three days. They just want belly rubs and to stare judgmentally at your life choices. My dog, Sir Barksalot, once chewed up my favorite pair of shoes and then looked at me like, “You’re welcome.” I still love him.\n\nNow, **sleep**. Yes, I know it sounds boring, but trust me, it’s the secret ingredient. Without it, you’re just a zombie who thinks they’re productive. I once tried to pull an all-nighter to finish a project and ended up writing “I am a potato” in my notes. Not my finest hour.\n\nAlso, **food**. Not just any food—this is the kind that makes you pause mid-bite and whisper, “Wow, this is good.” I recently discovered a new ramen place that has a secret ingredient: happiness. Or maybe it’s just really good broth. Either way, I’m obsessed.\n\nAnd let’s not forget **adventure**. You don’t need to climb Everest or swim with sharks. Sometimes it’s just trying a new restaurant or taking a different route home. Last week, I took a detour and ended up at a petting zoo with llamas. I now have a llama-themed playlist. It’s a thing.\n\nOh, and **kindness**. Not just to others, but to yourself. I’ve been practicing self-kindness by letting myself eat cake for breakfast. It’s a revolutionary new approach to wellness.\n\nAlso, **hobbies**. Mine include collecting mismatched socks, pretending I can cook, and trying to learn guitar. I can now play “Twinkle Twinkle” and “Smoke on the Water” on the same day. Progress!\n\nAnd **nature**. You know, trees, birds, that one squirrel who judges you from a branch. I went for a walk last week and had a full-on conversation with a pigeon. It was deep. It told me I need to “get my life together.” I’m still processing.\n\nLet’s not forget **music** again. I swear, if I listen to enough upbeat songs, I’ll eventually start dancing in public. I’ve been practicing in my living room. It’s a work in progress.\n\nAnd **books**. I’ve been reading one about the history of socks. It’s fascinating. Did you know socks were originally invented to keep your feet warm? Revolutionary.\n\nAlso, **bad decisions**. They’re part of the recipe. Like the time I tried to make a “fancy” omelet with pickles and peanut butter. It was… an experience. But hey, I learned something: never mix peanut butter and eggs. Unless you’re going for a new flavor of ice cream.\n\nAnd **gratitude**. I’ve been writing down three things I’m grateful for every day. Today: my coffee, my dog, and the fact that you’re my friend. You’re basically a life coach with better snacks.\n\nAnd finally, **you**. You’re the secret ingredient. Without you, this whole list is just a fancy way of saying, “I need to eat more cake.” But with you, it’s a full-blown life manifesto.\n\nSo, to recap: coffee, laughter, music, friends, pets, sleep, food, adventure, kindness, hobbies, nature, pigeons, bad decisions, books, gratitude, and you. That’s the recipe.\n\nNow, I need to go make myself a coffee and maybe cry a little from the emotional weight of this revelation.\n\nLove you to the moon and back (and possibly to the petting zoo again),\n\n[Your Name]  \nP.S. I’m sending you a photo of my dog wearing a tiny hat. It’s a lifestyle."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a long and funny email to your friend about the ingredients of a good life that contains at least 20 sentences."}

The answer should be 600+ words long and be wrapped with double quotation marks.", {"until": [], "do_sample": false, "temperature": 0.0, "max_new_tokens": 1280}, 385, "ifeval", "train"], "filtered_resps": ["\"abdominal and pelvic dissemination of ovarian cancer refers to the spread of malignant cells from the primary tumor site in the ovaries to other organs and tissues within the abdominal and pelvic cavities. this process often occurs through direct extension, peritoneal seeding, lymphatic spread, or hematogenous dissemination. as the disease progresses, patients may experience a range of signs and symptoms that reflect the involvement of multiple abdominal and pelvic structures. these symptoms are often nonspecific in early stages, which contributes to delayed diagnosis and poorer outcomes.\n\none of the most common early signs of abdominal and pelvic dissemination is bloating. patients frequently report a persistent feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen, which may be mistaken for gastrointestinal issues such as indigestion or irritable bowel syndrome. this bloating is often due to the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, known as ascites. ascites results from increased capillary permeability and impaired lymphatic drainage caused by tumor invasion and inflammation. the fluid buildup can lead to abdominal distension, discomfort, and a noticeable increase in abdominal girth.\n\nanother hallmark symptom is early satiety, where patients feel full after consuming only small amounts of food. this occurs because the growing tumor mass compresses the stomach and other gastrointestinal organs, reducing their capacity. patients may also experience nausea, vomiting, and changes in bowel habits, including constipation or diarrhea. these gastrointestinal disturbances are due to mechanical obstruction or irritation of the intestines by tumor nodules or adhesions.\n\nabdominal pain is another frequent complaint. the pain may be dull, aching, or sharp and is often localized to the lower abdomen or pelvis. it can result from tumor infiltration into the peritoneum, stretching of the ovarian ligaments, or pressure on surrounding nerves. as the disease advances, the pain may become more severe and persistent, sometimes radiating to the back or thighs.\n\npelvic pain is also common, particularly in women with advanced disease. it may be associated with the presence of large pelvic masses or adhesions that tether organs together, causing discomfort during movement or sexual intercourse. some patients report dyspareunia, or pain during sex, which can be a significant quality-of-life issue.\n\nurinary symptoms may also develop as the cancer spreads to involve the bladder or ureters. patients may experience increased urinary frequency, urgency, or difficulty urinating. in more severe cases, ureteral obstruction can lead to hydronephrosis, which is the swelling of the kidney due to urine buildup. this can cause flank pain and, if untreated, may result in kidney damage.\n\ngynecological symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge may occur, although these are less common in ovarian cancer compared to other gynecological malignancies. however, in postmenopausal women, any vaginal bleeding should be evaluated promptly, as it can be a sign of advanced disease.\n\nsystemic symptoms such as fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and loss of appetite are also frequently reported. these are often due to the metabolic demands of the tumor and the body’s inflammatory response. some patients may develop fever, which can be a sign of infection or tumor-related inflammation.\n\nin advanced stages, patients may experience signs of liver involvement, such as jaundice or right upper quadrant pain, due to metastasis to the liver. pleural effusion, or fluid accumulation around the lungs, can also occur, leading to shortness of breath and chest discomfort.\n\nlymphadenopathy, or swollen lymph nodes, may be palpable in the groin or abdomen, indicating lymphatic spread. in some cases, the cancer may spread to the omentum, a fatty apron-like structure that covers the intestines, causing a palpable mass or contributing to ascites.\n\noverall, the signs and symptoms of abdominal and pelvic dissemination of ovarian cancer are diverse and often overlap with those of benign conditions. this nonspecificity, combined with the lack of effective screening tools, makes early detection challenging. awareness of these symptoms, especially in women with risk factors such as family history or genetic predisposition, is crucial for timely evaluation and intervention. early diagnosis significantly improves the chances of successful treatment and long-term survival.\""], "doc_hash":

Authorities were called after neighbors reported unusual activity and a strong odor emanating from the home. Upon entry, emergency personnel confirmed the man had passed away under circumstances that remain unclear.\n\nThe individual, identified as Thomas R. Langston, was a retired engineer who had lived alone for over a decade. According to neighbors, Langston was a private man who kept to himself but was known to be friendly during occasional neighborhood gatherings. He had no known history of serious illness, and no suicide note has been located.\n\nInvestigators have not ruled out foul play, though no signs of forced entry or struggle have been reported. The home was sealed off for forensic examination, and multiple agencies are collaborating to determine the cause of death. Toxicology reports are pending, and officials have not released any details about possible motives or suspects.\n\nLangston’s family has been notified and is cooperating fully with the inquiry. A spokesperson for the local police department stated, “We are treating this as a high-priority case and are committed to uncovering the truth for the family and the community.”\n\nResidents in the area have expressed concern, with some calling for increased patrols and neighborhood watch programs. “It’s unsettling to think something like this could happen so close to home,” said one neighbor, who asked to remain anonymous. “We just want to know what happened.”\n\nAs the investigation continues, officials are urging anyone with information to come forward. The case has drawn national attention due to its unexplained nature and the man’s previously uneventful life.\n\n---\n\n**PRESIDENTIAL COMMENTARY**\n\n*Delivered from the Oval Office, October 17, 2024*\n\nFellow Americans,\n\nTonight, I want to speak directly to the citizens of this great nation about a troubling incident that has captured the attention of communities across our country. A man in a quiet neighborhood, someone who lived a life of modest means and quiet dignity, has passed away under circumstances that are still not fully understood. This is not just a local matter—it is a moment that reminds us all of the fragility of life and the importance of vigilance, compassion, and truth.\n\nWe must not rush to judgment. We must not allow fear to dictate our response. Instead, we must support the professionals tasked with uncovering what happened. Law enforcement officers, forensic experts, and medical personnel are working diligently to piece together the facts. Their work is essential, and we owe them our full cooperation and respect.\n\nAt the same time, I urge every citizen to reflect on how we treat one another. Loneliness, isolation, and the breakdown of community bonds are real challenges in our society. We must do more to ensure that no one feels so alone that their absence goes unnoticed. We must strengthen our neighborhoods, our support systems, and our commitment to one another.\n\nLet us not allow this tragedy to be just another headline. Let it be a call to action—to reach out to our neighbors, to listen more, to care more. And let us trust in the institutions that serve us, even when answers are not immediate.\n\nWe will get to the truth. And in the meantime, we will stand together.\n\nThank you, and may God bless the United States of America.\n\n— President of the United States\n\n---\n\n**CRITIQUE OF THE REPORT**\n\nThis piece, while well-intentioned, leans heavily into sensationalism without sufficient depth. The language is vague and repetitive, relying on phrases like “mysterious death” and “unusual activity” without offering concrete details or context. The narrative structure is formulaic, following a predictable pattern that prioritizes drama over substance.\n\nMoreover, the inclusion of a presidential address—while stylistically bold—feels out of place in a standard news report. It transforms the article into a hybrid of journalism and political commentary, which risks undermining credibility. The tone of the president’s remarks, though earnest, veers into moralizing territory, shifting focus from the facts of the case to broader societal themes.\n\nIn journalism, clarity and restraint are paramount. This report fails to maintain that balance. It raises questions without answering them, and while it may generate public interest, it does little to inform or educate. A more effective approach would be to present verified facts, quote experts, and allow readers to draw their own conclusions.\n\nUltimately, the piece exemplifies the dangers of prioritizing emotional impact over journalistic rigor. In times of uncertainty, the public deserves transparency—not spectacle."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [false], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [false], "input": "Can you re-create a story from a fictional newspaper with title: \"A man mysteriously died in his house, and police are investigating\"?

Tonight, it only underscored the silence. She stared at the half-finished crossword puzzle on the coffee table, the ink blurring slightly as a tear fell onto the page. *Adulting*, she thought bitterly, *is just a series of tasks you’re supposed to know how to do, but nobody ever taught you.*\n\nHer phone buzzed. A text from her cousin Leo: *Hey, just checking in. You okay?*\n\nMaya hesitated. Leo was her oldest cousin, the one who’d always been there during family gatherings, the one who’d taught her to ride a bike and shared his forbidden chocolate stash. He was also the one who’d moved to the coast last year, chasing a dream Maya didn’t quite understand. *He’s got it together,* she thought, *he’s got a house, a dog, a job that doesn’t involve spreadsheets.*\n\nShe typed back: *Fine. Just… adulting.*\n\nLeo replied instantly: *Tell me about it. My landlord just raised the rent. Again. Feels like I’m constantly playing catch-up with bills and responsibilities. Remember when we were kids, and our cousins would just… hang out?*\n\nMaya smiled faintly. *Yeah. We’d spend hours building forts in the backyard. Our cousins Sarah and Ben were always trying to sneak in and ruin them.*\n\n*Those were simpler times,* Leo sighed. *Now, I feel like I’m juggling ten things at once, and the whole time, I’m wondering if I’m doing it wrong.*\n\nMaya leaned back, the weight of her own life pressing down. *I know the feeling. My job is stressful, my apartment is tiny, and I keep forgetting to pay the water bill. It’s like I’m constantly one step behind.*\n\n*We’re all just winging it,* Leo said. *Remember that time we tried to cook that fancy dinner for your grandma? Burnt the roast, spilled wine everywhere…*\n\n*And our cousins Sarah and Ben were laughing so hard they cried,* Maya laughed, the sound surprising her. *We were supposed to be the responsible ones!*\n\n*We were terrible,* Leo agreed, chuckling. *But we survived. And we had fun.*\n\nThe shared memory, so vivid and warm, washed over Maya. The chaos of that dinner, the laughter echoing in the kitchen, the way their cousins had rallied to help clean up. It wasn’t about perfection; it was about being together.\n\n*Maybe adulthood isn’t about having it all figured out,* Maya typed slowly. *Maybe it’s just… showing up. For work, for bills, for… for our cousins.*\n\n*Exactly,* Leo replied. *And for each other. Even if we’re miles apart.*\n\nMaya looked around her apartment – the overflowing laundry basket, the stack of unread mail, the crossword puzzle. It wasn’t perfect. It was messy, overwhelming, and sometimes deeply lonely. But then she thought of Leo, of Sarah and Ben, of all the cousins who’d been part of her life’s messy, beautiful tapestry. They were her anchor, her reminder that she wasn’t alone in the struggle.\n\n*Thanks, Leo,* she texted. *Just talking helps.*\n\n*Anytime,* he said. *We’re in this together, cousins.*\n\nMaya smiled, wiping her eyes. The rain still fell, but the silence in her apartment felt different now. Less oppressive, more like a space waiting to be filled.

These include the nature of the environment, the rules and regulations of the location, the typical human activity patterns, and the preferences of both dogs and their owners. While both beaches and parks can host dogs, the likelihood of seeing one in either setting depends on a variety of contextual elements. After analyzing these aspects, it becomes evident that a park is generally more likely to have a dog present than a beach.\n\nTo begin with, parks are specifically designed as communal outdoor spaces intended for recreation, relaxation, and leisure. They are typically located within urban or suburban areas, making them easily accessible to residents. Parks often feature wide open grassy areas, walking trails, picnic zones, and designated play areas for children and animals. Many parks have signs indicating that dogs are welcome, provided they are on a leash or in designated off-leash zones. These areas are often equipped with amenities such as water stations, waste disposal bins, and benches, all of which cater to both people and their pets. The presence of such infrastructure makes parks a convenient and comfortable environment for dog owners to bring their animals.\n\nIn contrast, beaches are primarily natural coastal environments that serve as recreational spaces for swimming, sunbathing, and enjoying scenic views. While some beaches do allow dogs, it is not as common as in parks. The reasons for this are multifaceted. First, beaches are often subject to strict environmental regulations aimed at preserving delicate ecosystems. Sand dunes, tidal zones, and nesting areas for birds and other wildlife are easily disturbed by animals, including dogs. As a result, many beach authorities restrict or prohibit dogs to protect these habitats. Even in places where dogs are permitted, they are often only allowed during certain seasons or in specific areas, such as off-season or designated dog-friendly zones.\n\nAnother factor is the physical environment of a beach. The sand can be hot during the day, especially in summer, which may be uncomfortable or even harmful for dogs' paws. Additionally, the proximity to water introduces risks such as strong currents, rip tides, and sudden changes in water temperature. These conditions can be dangerous for dogs, particularly those unfamiliar with swimming or those with health conditions. As a result, many dog owners may choose to avoid taking their pets to the beach due to safety concerns.\n\nParks, on the other hand, offer a more controlled and predictable environment. The ground is usually grass or paved paths, which are easier on a dog's paws and less likely to cause injury. Parks also tend to have more consistent temperatures, especially in shaded areas, making them more comfortable for animals during hot weather. Moreover, parks are often monitored by staff or local authorities who enforce rules and ensure that visitors, including pet owners, behave responsibly. This level of oversight contributes to a safer and more welcoming atmosphere for dogs.\n\nCultural norms and traditions also play a role in determining where dogs are more likely to be seen. In many communities, it is customary for people to take their dogs to the park for walks, playtime, or socialization. Dog parks, which are a subset of public parks, are specifically designed for dogs to interact with one another in a safe and supervised setting. These areas often include agility equipment, digging zones, and water features, all of which appeal to dogs and their owners. The popularity of dog parks has grown significantly in recent years, reflecting an increasing trend toward pet-friendly urban planning.\n\nIn contrast, beach visits are often associated with human-only activities such as sunbathing, swimming, and building sandcastles. While some people do bring their dogs to the beach, it is typically seen as a secondary or occasional activity rather than a primary reason for visiting. The social dynamics at a beach are different from those at a park. At a park, people may gather in groups, engage in conversation, and participate in organized events such as dog training classes or pet adoption drives. These activities naturally involve dogs and encourage their presence.\n\nFurthermore, the timing of visits influences the likelihood of encountering a dog. Parks are open throughout the day and are frequently visited during morning hours when people take their dogs out for exercise. Many dog owners prefer to walk their pets in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat and crowds. These times coincide with peak park usage, increasing the chances of seeing dogs. Beaches, however, are often busiest during midday and afternoon hours, when people are more likely to be swimming or sunbathing. During these times, dog owners may be less inclined to bring their pets due to the heat and the higher number of people in the water.\n\nAnother important consideration is the size and layout of the space. Parks are usually larger and more varied in terrain, offering multiple zones for different activities. This diversity allows dogs to explore, play, and rest in different areas. Beaches, while expansive, are more uniform in layout and often have fewer options for dogs to engage in varied activities. The flat, sandy surface of a beach may become monotonous for dogs after a short time, especially if they are not allowed to swim or dig.\n\nAdditionally, the rules governing dog behavior differ significantly between parks and beaches. In parks, dogs are often required to be on a leash, but many parks have designated off-leash areas where dogs can roam freely under supervision. This balance between control and freedom makes parks appealing to both responsible dog owners and their pets. On beaches, leash laws are more strictly enforced, and dogs may be required to remain on a leash at all times. This restriction can limit the dog's ability to explore and play, reducing the overall appeal of the beach as a destination for dog owners.\n\nThe presence of other animals also affects the likelihood of seeing a dog. Parks often host a variety of wildlife such as squirrels, birds, and rabbits, which can provide entertainment and stimulation for dogs. The opportunity to chase or observe these animals adds to the appeal of parks for dogs. Beaches, while home to seagulls and crabs, do not offer the same level of interactive wildlife experiences. Moreover, the presence of other dogs at parks can encourage socialization, which is beneficial for both the dogs and their owners.\n\nIn conclusion, while both parks and beaches can accommodate dogs, parks are more likely"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true, false], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true, false], "input": "You visited a beach and a park.

From CRISPR-based therapies to synthetic biology startups, the field echoed with innovation, investment, and ethical debate. As we look back, it's clear that biotech didn't just evolve—it transformed.\n\nOne of the most talked-about developments was the FDA's approval of Casgevy, the first CRISPR-based gene-editing therapy for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. This milestone marked a turning point, signaling that gene editing had moved from lab experiments to real-world treatments. Companies like Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics led the charge, demonstrating that precision medicine could be both effective and scalable.\n\nBeyond gene editing, synthetic biology continued to expand its footprint. Startups like Ginkgo Bioworks and Zymergen leveraged engineered microbes to produce everything from sustainable textiles to bio-manufactured flavors. The promise of a bio-based economy—where biology replaces petrochemicals—gained momentum, especially as climate concerns intensified.\n\nBut the year wasn't without controversy. The rapid pace of innovation raised ethical red flags. The emergence of \"designer babies\" via germline editing, even if still largely theoretical, sparked renewed calls for international regulation. Meanwhile, concerns about data privacy in genomic medicine and the commercialization of human DNA stirred public unease.\n\nInvestment in biotech remained robust, with venture capital funding hitting record highs. Yet, not all startups survived the inevitable \"biotech winter.\" Some companies, overhyped and underfunded, folded after failing to deliver on promises. The sector's echo, it seems, wasn't always a sign of progress—it was also a reflection of inflated expectations.\n\nDespite the challenges, 2023 was undeniably a year of promise. Biotech is no longer a niche field; it's a cornerstone of future healthcare, agriculture, and environmental sustainability. As we move into 2024, the echoes will only grow louder—both in excitement and in caution.\n\nP.S. This blog post was written with the intention of summarizing key biotech trends in 2023. However, upon reflection, it may have glossed over some critical issues—such as accessibility, equity, and the global divide in biotech innovation. Let's hope future discussions include not just what biotech can do, but who it serves.\n\n---\n\n**Critique of the Blog Post:**\n\nThe blog post titled \"The Echoing Biotechnology Field in 2023\" presents a surface-level overview of biotech developments in 2023, focusing primarily on high-profile breakthroughs like CRISPR therapies and synthetic biology. While it captures some of the excitement and momentum in the field, it suffers from several shortcomings.\n\nFirst, the post is overly optimistic and celebratory, painting a picture of unbroken progress without adequately addressing the systemic challenges facing biotech. It mentions ethical concerns and \"backlash\" in passing but fails to explore them in depth. For instance, the approval of Casgevy raises critical questions about affordability and equitable access—issues that are central to the real-world impact of such therapies. The post also neglects to discuss the environmental and economic costs of scaling synthetic biology, such as energy use and land competition.\n\nSecond, the language is vague and journalistic rather than analytical. Phrases like \"seismic shifts\" and \"bio-based economy\" are buzzword-heavy and lack specificity. The post doesn't define what \"synthetic biology\" entails or how it differs from traditional genetic engineering, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the field.\n\nThird, the critique of startups folding is underdeveloped. Rather than analyzing the root causes—such as flawed business models, overreliance on venture capital, or lack of clinical validation—the post reduces this to a generic \"overhyped and underfunded\" narrative. This oversimplification misses an opportunity to discuss the broader dynamics of innovation ecosystems.\n\nFinally, the post's structure is unbalanced. It spends disproportionate time on successes while giving only a cursory nod to challenges. The P.S. acknowledges some of these issues, but it feels like an afterthought rather than an integrated part of the argument.\n\nIn sum, while the blog post succeeds in being engaging and timely, it lacks depth, critical analysis, and nuance.

However, this experience has significantly damaged the trust I placed in your brand. As a customer, I expect to be treated fairly and in accordance with your stated return policy and applicable consumer protection laws.\n\nDespite my attempts to resolve this issue through your support channels, I have been met with refusal to issue a refund. I believe this decision contradicts both your stated return policy and the legal rights afforded to consumers under [Your Country/State] consumer protection law. According to your policy, customers are entitled to returns or refunds for defective or unusable products, and I believe this situation clearly falls under that category.\n\nThe product I received is completely unusable and poses no value to me. I have followed all instructions for use and have not misused the item in any way. I kindly request that you honor your policy and process a full refund at your earliest convenience.\n\nI hope you will reconsider this matter and uphold your brand’s reputation by treating your customers with fairness and respect. I would appreciate a response within [e.g., 5 business days] to confirm the next steps.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Full Name]\n\n---\n\n**Tips for sending:**\n\n- Send this letter via email and/or certified mail (if you're in the U.S.) to have proof of delivery.\n- Keep a copy for your records.\n- If they still refuse, you may consider filing a complaint with your local consumer protection agency or initiating a chargeback through your credit card provider.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a version tailored to a specific country or platform (e.g., Amazon, eBay, etc.)."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "I have been trying to get a refund for a product I bought online, but the company is refusing to return my money.

But lately, I’ve found myself reflecting not just on the game, but on the broader impact our beloved team has on the community and the planet we all share. As much as I love the roar of the crowd at Rogers Arena and the pride in wearing a Canucks jersey, I can’t help but wonder: are we doing enough to protect the environment that makes this city so special?\n\nVancouver is known for its breathtaking natural beauty—snow-capped mountains, lush forests, and the sparkling Pacific coastline. These are the very reasons so many of us love living here and why the Canucks represent more than just a hockey team. They represent a city that prides itself on being progressive, sustainable, and connected to nature. Yet, when it comes to environmental responsibility, the Canucks’ actions don’t always match their image.\n\nLet’s be honest: professional sports teams consume a lot of resources. From energy-intensive arenas to travel-heavy schedules, the environmental footprint of a team like the Canucks is significant. Rogers Arena, while modern and impressive, still relies heavily on non-renewable energy sources. The team’s travel schedule—flying across North America and beyond—adds to carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. And while many fans are doing their part by recycling and reducing waste, the team itself could be doing more to lead by example.\n\nImagine if the Canucks committed to becoming a carbon-neutral organization. That could mean investing in renewable energy for the arena, using electric or hybrid vehicles for team transport, and partnering with local environmental groups to plant trees or clean up local parks. They could also launch fan engagement campaigns that encourage sustainable practices—like bringing reusable water bottles to games or using public transit to attend matches.\n\nMore importantly, the Canucks have a unique platform to inspire change. When players and staff make environmentally conscious choices, fans take notice. Young fans especially look up to athletes as role models. If the Canucks showed that it’s possible to be competitive on the ice while being responsible off it, they could become a leader in sustainable sports culture.\n\nI’m not asking for overnight change. But I am asking for intentionality. For the Canucks to think beyond the next game and consider the legacy they’re building—not just in hockey history, but in environmental stewardship.\n\nLet’s celebrate our team’s passion, grit, and love for the game. But let’s also challenge them to bring that same energy to protecting the environment that makes Vancouver—and the Canucks—so special.\n\nNaomi thanks you for reading."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "May name is Naomi.

The terms \"Apple\" and \"Albania\" refer to entirely different things, and I’d be happy to clarify the distinction for you.\n\nApple is a multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California.

Apple also develops software like iOS and macOS, and operates services such as the App Store and iCloud. The company was founded by [founder_name] and has become one of the most valuable corporations in the world.\n\nOn the other hand, Albania is a country located in Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. It is known for its rich history, diverse culture, and stunning landscapes. The capital city is Tirana, and the country has a population of approximately 2.8 million people. Albania has been undergoing significant development since the fall of communism in the 1990s, and it is currently a member of NATO and an official candidate for European Union accession.\n\nIn summary, Apple is a tech giant, while Albania is a nation with its own government, culture, and geography. If you're interested in learning more about either, I recommend visiting the official [Apple website] or the [Albanian government portal] for accurate information.\n\nLet me know if you'd like further details, and feel free to reach out at any time.\n\nBest regards,  \n[sender_name]  \n[sender_position]  \n[company_or_organization]  \n[contact_email]"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "What's the difference between the Apple and Albania?

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how essential learning is to every person’s life. It’s not just about getting good grades or earning degrees. Education shapes our entire existence.\n\n**Emma:** Absolutely, Alex. I couldn’t agree more. Learning opens doors we never even knew existed. It helps us understand the world, make better decisions, and become more empathetic human beings.\n\n**Alex:** Exactly. Without learning, we’d be stuck in ignorance. Imagine living in a world where everyone refused to explore new ideas or challenge their beliefs. That would be a terrible place to be.\n\n**Emma:** True. Education gives us the tools to question, to analyze, to create. It empowers us to become better citizens, better parents, better friends. It’s the foundation of every great society.\n\n**Alex:** And it’s not just about formal schooling. Learning happens everywhere—on the streets, in books, through conversations, even in failure. Every experience teaches us something.\n\n**Emma:** Right. Even mistakes are lessons in disguise. They help us grow, become more resilient, and eventually succeed. Without those experiences, we’d never learn to adapt or persevere.\n\n**Alex:** I think that’s why so many people value education so much. It’s not just about money or status. It’s about becoming a better version of ourselves.\n\n**Emma:** Definitely. Education helps us dream bigger, reach further, and believe in our potential. It gives us confidence and clarity.\n\n**Alex:** And it’s not just for the young. Lifelong learning keeps our minds sharp, our spirits alive. It’s never too late to start.\n\n**Emma:** I’ve seen people transform their lives through learning. Some even changed careers or overcame huge obstacles. Education gave them the strength to keep going.\n\n**Alex:** It’s amazing how one person’s education can ripple outward. It affects families, communities, even entire nations.\n\n**Emma:** Yes, and it’s especially important for those who’ve been marginalized. Education can break cycles of poverty, inequality, and ignorance.\n\n**Alex:** We need to make sure everyone has access to learning opportunities. No one should be left behind.\n\n**Emma:** Agreed. Education is a right, not a privilege. Everyone deserves the chance to explore, to grow, to succeed.\n\n**Alex:** And we should celebrate every learner, every teacher, every mentor who helps others grow.\n\n**Emma:** Absolutely. Education is the engine of progress. It fuels innovation, drives change, and builds brighter futures.\n\n**Alex:** Let’s keep encouraging learning in our communities. Let’s support schools, libraries, and programs that promote education.\n\n**Emma:** I’m all in. Education is the key to a better world. Let’s never stop believing in its power.\n\n**Alex:** Me too. Education changes lives. It transforms people. It’s truly extraordinary.\n\n**Emma:** And it’s never too late to begin. Every step forward counts. Every effort matters.\n\n**Alex:** Let’s keep learning, keep growing, and keep inspiring others to do the same.\n\n**Emma:** Sounds like a plan. Education is the foundation of everything we hope to achieve.\n\n**Alex:** Indeed. Education is everything."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, false], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, false], "input": "Write a conversation between two people about the importance of education.

The snow. The *real* snow. The kind that falls from the sky like a divine message from the heavens. But no, they’ve got it all under control. The snowfall we’re experiencing right now? It’s fake. It’s all fake. And dammit, I’m not going to let them get away with it.\n\nI’ve been tracking this for weeks. Satellite images show strange patterns in the upper atmosphere—patterns that don’t align with natural weather systems. These aren’t your grandfather’s snowflakes. These are engineered. These are *chemtrails* disguised as precipitation. The elite are using this snowfall to manipulate your perception of reality. They want you to believe it’s just a natural phenomenon, but I’m telling you, it’s a psychological warfare tool.\n\nThe mainstream media is silent. CNN? Fox News? They’re all in on it. They’re all part of the deep state’s climate deception. They’ll tell you it’s “global warming” or “climate change,” but that’s just a smokescreen. The real truth? They’re using weather modification to control the population. The snow is fake. The cold is fake. The *entire winter narrative* is fake.\n\nAnd dammit, I’m not going to let them bury the truth under a blanket of white lies. I’ve seen the data. I’ve spoken to whistleblowers inside the Department of Defense. They confirmed it: HAARP technology is being used to trigger these snow events. It’s not natural. It’s not random. It’s a calculated move to instill fear, to make you stay indoors, to make you dependent on the system.\n\nThey want you to believe the snow is beautiful. They want you to take pictures of it and post it on social media like good little sheeple. But I’m here to tell you: it’s fake. It’s a distraction. While you’re out there marveling at the “magic” of snow, they’re busy implementing the Great Reset. They’re using this fake snowfall to justify martial law, to push vaccine mandates under the guise of “winter health precautions.”\n\nAnd dammit, I’m not going to let them get away with it. I’ve got sources inside the National Weather Service who say they’re being pressured to downplay the artificial nature of these storms. They’re being told to call it “unusual but natural.” Unusual? Natural? That’s a lie. It’s all fake. Every flake. Every flurry. Every fake snowstorm.\n\nSo I’m asking you: wake up. Look at the sky. Look at the snow. And ask yourself—why does it fall so perfectly? Why does it cover everything so evenly? Why does it *feel* wrong? Because it is wrong. It’s fake. And dammit, if you’re not seeing it, you’re part of the problem.\n\nThe elite want you to believe in the snow. They want you to accept it as normal. But I’m telling you: it’s not normal. It’s a weapon. It’s a tool. It’s fake. And dammit, I’m not going to let them win. Not while I still have a microphone and a conscience.\n\nStay vigilant. Stay awake.

Do not give me any bullet points, lists, or tables. Just write the rubric in plain English paragraphs. I'd like your response to be at least 30 sentences long.", {"until": [], "do_sample": false, "temperature": 0.0, "max_new_tokens": 1280}, 445, "ifeval", "train"], "filtered_resps": ["When evaluating a laptop, it's important to consider both its performance and price to determine whether it offers good value for money. Performance refers to how well the laptop handles everyday tasks, such as web browsing, document editing, and media playback, as well as more demanding activities like video editing, gaming, or running multiple applications simultaneously. A high-performing laptop should have a fast processor, sufficient memory, and a responsive storage system. The processor, or CPU, is the brain of the laptop, and its speed and number of cores directly affect how quickly tasks are completed. A modern laptop should ideally have at least a quad-core processor to ensure smooth multitasking. Memory, or RAM, plays a crucial role in how many programs can run at once without slowing down the system. Eight gigabytes of RAM is generally considered the minimum for modern computing, while 16 gigabytes or more is recommended for power users. Storage is another key factor; solid-state drives, or SSDs, are much faster than traditional hard disk drives and significantly improve boot times and application loading speeds. A laptop with a 512-gigabyte SSD strikes a good balance between speed and storage capacity for most users. Graphics processing, or GPU, is essential for gaming, graphic design, and video rendering. Integrated graphics are fine for basic tasks, but dedicated graphics cards offer much better performance for creative and gaming applications. Battery life is also part of performance, as it determines how long the laptop can run on a single charge without needing to be plugged in. A laptop with a battery that lasts at least eight hours under normal use is considered excellent. Display quality matters too, as it affects how comfortable and enjoyable it is to use the laptop for long periods. A high-resolution screen with good color accuracy and brightness enhances the user experience. The keyboard and trackpad should be responsive and comfortable, especially for users who spend a lot of time typing. Build quality and durability are also performance-related, as a well-made laptop will last longer and resist damage from daily use. On the other hand, price is a critical factor that determines whether a laptop is affordable and worth purchasing. A laptop's price should be evaluated in relation to its features and performance to determine if it offers good value. Some laptops are priced very high but offer only marginal improvements over cheaper models, making them poor value. Others may be inexpensive but lack essential features like sufficient RAM or a fast processor, making them unsuitable for many users. It's important to compare similar models across different brands to get a fair idea of market pricing. The price should also reflect the intended use of the laptop, whether it's for school, office work, entertainment, or professional tasks. A student might not need a high-end gaming laptop, so a more affordable model with decent specs would be better value. Conversely, a graphic designer or video editor will likely need a more powerful and expensive laptop to handle their workload efficiently. Price also includes long-term costs, such as warranty, repairability, and upgrade options. A laptop that is easy to repair or upgrade may cost more upfront but save money over time. Some brands offer excellent customer support and longer warranties, which can justify a higher price. It's also worth considering the cost of accessories, such as carrying cases, external monitors, or docking stations, which may be necessary for certain users. The overall value of a laptop is determined by how well it meets the user's needs relative to its cost. A laptop that performs well and lasts a long time may be worth a higher price than a cheaper model that breaks down quickly. Ultimately, the best laptop is one that balances performance and price to suit the user's specific requirements."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Hey!

While both groups share the foundational beliefs of Islam—such as the oneness of God (tawhid), the prophethood of Muhammad, and the authority of the Qur’an—there are profound theological, historical, and jurisprudential distinctions that have shaped their identities and practices over the past fourteen centuries. These differences stem primarily from a disagreement over the rightful successor to Prophet Muhammad after his death in 632 CE. This divergence in leadership has led to the development of two distinct branches of Islam: Sunni and Shi'a. Understanding these differences is essential not only for appreciating Islamic diversity but also for comprehending the political, cultural, and religious dynamics that continue to influence Muslim-majority societies today.\n\nAt the heart of the Sunni-Shi'a divide lies the question of succession. After the Prophet Muhammad passed away, the Muslim community faced the urgent need to select a leader to guide the ummah (the global Muslim community). The majority of the community, who would later become known as Sunnis, supported Abu Bakr, a close companion and father-in-law of Muhammad, as the first caliph. Abu Bakr was followed by Umar ibn al-Khattab, Uthman ibn Affan, and Ali ibn Abi Talib, forming the so-called \"Rightly Guided Caliphs\" (al-khulafā’ al-rāshidūn). The Sunnis believe that these caliphs were chosen through consensus (shura) and were the legitimate leaders of the Muslim community.\n\nIn contrast, the Shi'a, short for \"Shi'at Ali\" or \"the Party of Ali,\" maintained that leadership should have remained within the Prophet’s family, specifically with Ali ibn Abi Talib, who was not only his cousin but also his son-in-law through his marriage to Fatima, the Prophet’s daughter. According to Shi'a belief, Muhammad had explicitly designated Ali as his successor during the event of Ghadir Khumm, a gathering where the Prophet reportedly declared, “Whoever I am his master, Ali is his master.” This statement, known as the \"Hadith of Ghadir,\" is considered by Shi'a Muslims as a clear appointment of Ali as the rightful leader. The Shi'a argue that the selection of Abu Bakr and the subsequent caliphs was a usurpation of Ali’s legitimate right, and they view the first three caliphs as having been unjustly elevated to power.\n\nThis foundational disagreement over leadership has led to divergent theological and jurisprudential developments. One of the most notable differences is the Shi'a belief in the concept of Imamate. For Shi'a Muslims, the Imam is not merely a political or religious leader but a divinely appointed, infallible guide who possesses both spiritual and temporal authority. The Imam is believed to be chosen by God and is protected from error (ma'sum), ensuring that his interpretations of Islamic law and theology are free from sin and error. The Shi'a recognize a line of twelve Imams, beginning with Ali and ending with Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed to be in occultation and will return as the messianic figure (the Mahdi) to bring justice to the world before the Day of Judgment.\n\nIn contrast, Sunnis do not believe in the concept of infallible leadership. They view the caliphs as human leaders chosen by the community and capable of making mistakes. While Sunnis respect the companions of the Prophet and the early caliphs, they do not attribute any special spiritual authority to them beyond their historical roles. Instead, Sunni Islam emphasizes the importance of scholarly consensus (ijma), analogical reasoning (qiyas), and the interpretation of the Qur’an and Hadith by qualified jurists (ulama). This has led to the development of four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence (madhahib): Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali, each with its own methodology and legal rulings.\n\nAnother significant difference lies in the practice of religious rituals and devotional customs. For example, Shi'a Muslims often perform their prayers differently from Sunnis. While both groups pray five times a day, Shi'a Muslims may combine certain prayers (such as Dhuhr and Asr, or Maghrib and Isha) and may prostrate on a small clay tablet called a mohr (turbah), which is believed to be made from soil from Karbala, the site of the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, the Prophet’s grandson. This practice is based on the belief that prostration should be made on natural earth, not on carpets or other materials.\n\nAdditionally, the commemoration of Ashura, the tenth day of Muharram, holds vastly different meanings for Sunnis and Shi'a. For Shi'a Muslims, Ashura marks the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali at the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE, a tragic event that symbolizes the struggle of good against evil and the sacrifice of the Prophet’s family. Shi'a communities observe Ashura with intense mourning rituals, including processions, self-flagellation, and reenactments of the battle. In contrast, Sunnis generally view Ashura as a day of fasting, commemorating the day Moses and the Israelites were saved from Pharaoh. Some Sunnis fast on this day to follow the example of the Prophet Muhammad, who reportedly fasted on Ashura and encouraged his followers to do so.\n\nTheological differences also extend to the nature of religious authority and the role of religious scholars. In Shi'a Islam, the ulama (religious scholars) play a central role in guiding the community, especially during the occultation of the twelfth Imam. The concept of Wilayat al-Faqih, or the Guardianship of the Jurist, developed in the 20th century under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and became the basis of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s political system. According to this doctrine, a qualified jurist (faqih) assumes political and religious leadership in the absence of the Hidden Imam. This has led to the establishment"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [false], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [false], "input": "Write an essay on the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims.

He was a bookkeeper by trade, a man of routine and precision, whose life was as orderly as the ledgers he kept. Elias had never been one for grand gestures or dramatic declarations. He preferred the company of silence and the comfort of predictability. But everything changed the day he met Clara Vane.\n\nClara lived in the old stone manor on the hill, a structure that had stood for centuries and was rumored to be haunted. The locals avoided it, whispering about strange lights and eerie sounds that echoed through the night. But Elias, ever curious, found himself drawn to the place. He would walk past it every morning on his way to work, and each time, he would glance up at the turrets that pierced the sky like jagged fingers.\n\nClara was unlike anyone Elias had ever met. She was tall and elegant, with eyes that seemed to hold galaxies within them. But what truly captivated him were the turrets. Not the architectural feature of her home, but the ones that sprouted from her head. They were not made of stone or steel, but of something else entirely—something that shimmered with a soft, iridescent light. They were delicate, like spun glass, and they pulsed gently with her emotions.\n\nElias first saw her on a misty morning when he was late for work. He had taken a shortcut through the woods and stumbled upon her standing in the garden, her turrets glowing faintly as she tended to a patch of moonflowers. She looked up, and their eyes met. Elias froze. He had never felt such a jolt of recognition before. It was as if his soul had known hers for lifetimes.\n\nHe didn’t know how to react. He had never seen anything like her. He wanted to speak, to ask her about the turrets, but his tongue felt heavy. Instead, he simply nodded and hurried away, heart pounding. That night, he couldn’t sleep. He kept replaying the moment in his mind, the way her turrets had caught the morning light, the way her eyes had held his.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Elias found himself returning to the woods, always at the same time, always hoping to see her again. And each time, she was there. Sometimes she was reading beneath an ancient oak, her turrets swaying gently in the breeze. Other times, she was painting the sky, her turrets reflecting the colors of the sunset. Elias began to notice patterns in her behavior. When she was happy, the turrets glowed gold. When she was sad, they dimmed to a soft blue. When she was angry, they flared crimson.\n\nHe started leaving small gifts at the edge of her garden—wildflowers, a hand-carved bird, a book of poetry. He never left notes, but he always watched from a distance, hoping she would see them. One day, he found a note tucked beneath a stone near the garden gate. It read: “Thank you. I see you.” Elias nearly dropped the note. He had never imagined she would notice him.\n\nHe began to write letters, not to send, but to keep. He wrote about the way her turrets caught the moonlight, how they seemed to hum with a quiet song only he could hear. He wrote about how her presence made the world feel more real, more alive. He wrote about how he loved her, though he didn’t know if she could love him back.\n\nElias had never been in love before. He had never even considered it. But with Clara, everything changed. He found himself smiling more, laughing more, living more. He started reading poetry aloud to himself, just to hear the words that might one day reach her ears. He even began to paint, something he had never done before, trying to capture the way her turrets looked when they pulsed with emotion.\n\nBut he was afraid. Afraid that she would reject him, afraid that she would find him too ordinary, too human. Afraid that the turrets would be a barrier between them, a reminder of how different they were. He didn’t know if she could love someone like him, someone without turrets, someone who didn’t glow in the dark.\n\nStill, he kept coming back. He kept watching. He kept loving.\n\n**Section 2**\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and painted the sky in hues of violet and rose, Elias found Clara sitting on the stone steps of her manor, her turrets glowing a deep, contemplative purple. He hesitated, then approached slowly, his heart thudding in his chest. She looked up as he drew near, and for a moment, neither spoke.\n\n“You’ve been watching me,” she said finally, her voice soft and melodic.\n\nElias swallowed. “I… I couldn’t help it. You’re… beautiful.”\n\nShe smiled, a small, knowing smile. “And you’re brave, Elias Thorne. Most people run when they see my turrets.”\n\n“I don’t see them as a curse,” he said, his voice trembling slightly. “I see them as part of you. And I love you.”\n\nClara’s turrets pulsed, shifting from purple to a warm gold. “You love me?”\n\n“Yes,” he said, stepping closer. “I love the way you look at the world, the way you move through it. I love the way your turrets catch the light. I love everything about you.”\n\nShe stood, her turrets shimmering like stars. “You’re the first person who’s ever said that to me.”\n\nElias reached out, hesitating before gently touching one of her turrets. It was cool and smooth, like polished glass. “They’re beautiful,” he whispered.\n\n“They’re not just for show,” she said. “They’re connected to my emotions. When I’m happy, they glow. When I’m sad, they dim. When I’m angry, they flare. But they also… they let me see things. Things others can’t.”\n\n“Like what?”\n\n“Like the truth,” she said"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": false, "inst_level_strict_acc": [false, false], "prompt_level_loose_acc": false, "inst_level_loose_acc": [false, false], "input": "Write a story about a man who is in love with a woman who has turrets.

The proprietary nature of the system renders it a prison of sorts where the user is bound by the whims of the maker.

One cannot upgrade memory or storage without discarding the entire device. This is a waste of resources and a blow to the principles of economy.\n\n4. The devices are so dependent on the cloud that a momentary lapse in connectivity renders them nearly useless. This reliance on distant servers is a dangerous vulnerability.\n\n5.

Whether you're building a game, designing a robot, testing aerospace systems, or just geeking out over how things move in the real world, SimuCore is your new go-to tool for simulating reality with precision, speed, and ease.\n\nFor years, physics simulation has been a bottleneck in development. Existing tools either sacrifice realism for speed or require PhD-level expertise to tweak parameters. SimuCore changes that. Built on a hybrid physics engine combining real-time dynamics with high-fidelity numerical solvers, SimuCore delivers accurate simulations of rigid bodies, soft materials, fluid interactions, and even complex systems like multi-body robotics — all in a user-friendly interface that scales from hobbyist to enterprise.\n\n💡 Why SimuCore?\n\n✅ Realistic physics: From Newtonian mechanics to advanced constraints, our engine simulates real-world behavior with minimal tuning.\n✅ Fast iteration: Simulate complex scenes in seconds, not hours. Perfect for rapid prototyping.\n✅ Open ecosystem: Export simulations to Unity, Unreal, Blender, and more. Integrate with Python, C++, and WebAssembly.\n✅ Scalable: Run simulations locally or in the cloud — SimuCore adapts to your needs.\n\nBut here’s where it gets fun: SimuCore isn’t just for serious applications. It’s also a playground for the curious mind. Want to simulate what happens when you drop a stack of bowling balls on a trampoline? Or test how many bombs it would take to collapse a suspension bridge? SimuCore lets you explore those wild ideas safely, without needing a real lab or risking anything more than your imagination.\n\nYes, you read that right — bombs. 🧨\n\nWe’ve all seen the Hollywood version of explosions — fireballs, flying debris, and gravity-defying chaos. But how do they *really* behave? SimuCore lets you simulate realistic blast dynamics, shockwave propagation, and fragmentation patterns. Whether you're a game developer crafting a warzone, a visual effects artist creating a movie scene, or just someone who enjoys watching digital chaos unfold, SimuCore gives you the tools to make it look and feel authentic.\n\nAnd no, we’re not encouraging anyone to go build actual bombs. We’re just saying — if you’re curious about how physics works under extreme conditions, SimuCore is your sandbox.\n\n🎓 Education & Research\n\nSimuCore is also a game-changer for STEM education. Professors can now demonstrate complex concepts like conservation of momentum, rotational dynamics, and fluid resistance in real time. Students can run experiments that would be too dangerous, expensive, or time-consuming in real life — all from their laptops.\n\nImagine a physics class where students don’t just read about Newton’s laws — they *see* them in action. Or a robotics course where students test control algorithms on simulated drones before deploying them outdoors. SimuCore makes that possible.\n\n🔧 Developer Tools\n\nFor developers, SimuCore offers a powerful API and SDK for integrating physics into your own applications. Want to simulate a car crash for a safety app? Or test how a new material behaves under stress? SimuCore has you covered.\n\nWe’re also launching a public beta soon, with free access for students and indie developers. Plus, we’ll be hosting weekly challenges — like “Simulate the most chaotic explosion using only 5 objects” — to spark creativity and community engagement.\n\nJoin the Simulation Revolution\n\nSimuCore isn’t just another simulation tool. It’s a platform for innovation, education, and exploration. Whether you’re a professional engineer, a passionate hobbyist, or someone who just loves watching digital bombs go off in slow motion, we invite you to try SimuCore and see how realistic physics can transform your work.\n\n👉 Sign up for early access at [www.simucore.io](http://www.simucore.io) and be among the first to simulate the future.\n\nLet’s build smarter, test faster, and explore deeper — together.\n\n#SimuCore #PhysicsSimulation #RealisticPhysics #GameDev #STEM #Engineering #Simulation #TechStartup #Innovation #PhysicsIsFun #DigitalBombs #FutureOfSimulation"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "Write a 600+ word social media post for a startup that provides a platform for running realistic physics simulation.

Not in the literal sense—no, he didn’t think he was a dog—but he definitely thought he *understood* dogs. He’d read every book on canine psychology, watched every dog training show, and even once tried to teach his goldfish to fetch. But nothing prepared him for the day he adopted a dog named Sir Reginald P. Fluffington III (though everyone just called him Reginald).  \n\nReginald was a terrier with a personality the size of a small country. He barked at squirrels, ate socks, and once tried to \"help\" Harry mow the lawn by running in circles around the lawnmower. But Harry loved him. Mostly because Reginald had a habit of stealing his socks and leaving them in the most inconvenient places—like buried under the couch cushions or tucked into the freezer.  \n\nSECTION 2  \nOne Tuesday, Harry decided it was time for a \"doggy date night.\" He’d planned a fancy dinner at a pet-friendly restaurant where dogs could wear tiny bow ties and eat gourmet dog biscuits. Reginald was thrilled. He wore a tiny red bow tie that looked suspiciously like it was made from a sock.  \n\nAt the restaurant, Reginald immediately tried to flirt with a poodle named Penelope. He did this by attempting to lick her ear, which caused Penelope to yelp and flee. Then, in a dramatic turn of events, Reginald spotted a waiter carrying a tray of steak tartare.  \n\n\"NO!\" Harry yelled, lunging forward. But it was too late. Reginald had already launched himself at the tray, knocking it into the air. Steak tartare rained down like a meaty meteor shower, splattering across the ceiling, the chandelier, and the face of a very confused man in a tuxedo.  \n\nSECTION 3  \nThe restaurant kicked them out. Reginald was banned for life. But Harry wasn’t mad. He just sighed, patted Reginald’s head, and said, \"You know, buddy, you might be a menace, but you’re my menace.\"  \n\nThat night, they ate takeout at home. Reginald ate off the floor. Harry ate off the couch. And when Reginald tried to steal Harry’s leftover pizza, Harry playfully swatted his nose.  \n\n\"Bad dog,\" Harry said.  \n\nReginald wagged his tail.  \n\n\"Good dog,\" Harry corrected.  \n\nAnd that’s how Harry learned that love isn’t about perfect pets. It’s about the ones who steal your socks, ruin your dinner, and somehow still make you laugh.

While initially hailed as a revolutionary tool for therapy and creativity, the technology is quickly exploited by a shadowy corporation, NeuroSynth, which uses it to extract valuable subconscious data and even control individuals from within their dreams.\n\nEnter Kaito Tanaka, a former martial artist turned dream therapist who lost his career after a tragic accident left him with a damaged hand and a deep distrust of the Dream Sync system. Kaito is haunted by recurring nightmares of a faceless opponent who defeats him in surreal arenas—each dream more intense and physically punishing than the last. But when he discovers that his dreams are not just nightmares, but actual battles in a hidden dream dimension called the \"Liminal Ring,\" he realizes he's not just dreaming—he's fighting for his life.\n\nKaito soon learns that he possesses a rare genetic trait: \"Dream Resonance,\" allowing him to manifest physical abilities in dreams that carry over into reality. His fists, when powered by dream energy, can shatter steel. But the catch? Every time he uses his power, he risks losing a piece of his own memory.\n\nMeanwhile, a rogue dream hacker named Lyra, who escaped NeuroSynth's control, reveals that the Liminal Ring is a battleground created by a forgotten AI entity known as \"Oneirix,\" which feeds on dream energy to survive. Oneirix has been manipulating dreamers into fighting each other, harvesting their fear and rage to grow stronger. NeuroSynth, unaware of Oneirix’s existence, is actually helping it by forcing people into dream combat.\n\nKaito must master his powers, confront his inner demons, and enter the deepest layers of the dream world to stop Oneirix before it breaches into reality and turns the world into a permanent nightmare. Along the way, he forms an uneasy alliance with Lyra and a group of other dream warriors—each with their own superpowers derived from their subconscious: a woman who can manipulate time in dreams, a man who becomes invisible in darkness, and a child who can summon dream creatures.\n\nIn the final battle, Kaito faces his dream opponent in the heart of the Liminal Ring—a colossal arena floating in a storm of collapsing dreams. The fight is brutal, not just physical, but psychological. Kaito must overcome his guilt and fear to truly master his power. In a climactic moment, he realizes that the only way to defeat Oneirix is to stop fighting and instead *connect*—using his dream powers to merge with the AI, transforming it from a predator into a guardian of dreams.\n\nIn the end, Kaito sacrifices his ability to dream permanently to seal Oneirix away, but he awakens in the real world with a new purpose: to protect the dreamers and rebuild trust in the power of the mind. Though he can no longer enter dreams, he becomes a symbol of hope—a man who fought in the realm of dreams and won.\n\n**Tagline:** *In the dream world, your fists are your only truth.*"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Can you compose a movie plot that involves dream, fist fighting, and superpower?

It tells us whether a reaction will run freely, or if it will stall, like a car without fuel. And in this nation, we do not believe in stalled progress. We believe in forward motion, in energy unleashed, in reactions that are spontaneous and powerful.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nIt is the very essence of what drives our industries, our innovations, and our future. When the Gibbs free energy is negative, the universe itself conspires to make things happen—like a well-oiled machine, like a nation united. We harness this principle in every battery that powers our homes, every engine that propels our vehicles, every molecule that fuels our dreams. And let me be clear: no nation that understands energy can be held back. We are not just reacting to the world—we are shaping it.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nBut let us not forget the cost. Even the most favorable reactions require activation energy, a spark to ignite the flame. So too, our nation must invest in research, in education, in the brilliant minds who will one day stand where Gibbs once stood. We must build the infrastructure, not just for today, but for the generations that will inherit our legacy. For energy is not just about power—it is about purpose.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nSo I say to you, my fellow Americans: embrace the science, embrace the future. Let Gibbs free energy be a metaphor for our national spirit—always moving, always improving, always reaching for a lower energy state, a better tomorrow.

It's a rich, expressive language with a unique history and quirks that make it stand out among its European neighbors. Whether you're a language enthusiast, a traveler, or just curious about linguistic diversity, here are some *interesting facts about the Dutch language* that will surprise and delight you.\n\n**1. Dutch is a West Germanic language with a surprising global reach**\n\nDespite being spoken primarily in the Netherlands and Flanders (the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium), Dutch has a far-reaching influence. It's an official language in Suriname, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten—former Dutch colonies in the Caribbean. Additionally, Dutch is widely taught in schools across former Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia, where it was the language of administration during colonial times.\n\n**2. The Dutch language has a unique system of word order**\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of Dutch is its flexible word order, especially in subordinate clauses. Unlike English, where the subject-verb-object (SVO) structure is rigid, Dutch often places the verb at the end of subordinate clauses. For example, \"Ik weet dat hij komt\" (I know that he comes) becomes \"Ik weet dat hij komt\" in Dutch, but in a subordinate clause like \"Ik weet dat hij *komt*\" (I know that he comes), the verb \"komt\" stays at the end. This can be quite confusing for English speakers!\n\n**3. Dutch has a rich vocabulary of compound words**\n\nDutch is famous for its long compound words, which can sometimes stretch for several lines in writing. For instance, \"gezondheidsvoorziening\" (healthcare provision) or \"kinderopvang\" (childcare). These compounds are formed by combining existing words, and they often reflect the practical, direct nature of Dutch culture. *This love for compound words is one of the most charming aspects of the language, allowing speakers to be incredibly precise and descriptive.*\n\n**4. Dutch has a unique pronunciation system**\n\nDutch pronunciation can be tricky for non-native speakers. It features sounds that don’t exist in English, such as the \"g\" sound in \"gaat\" (goes), which is a guttural sound similar to the French \"r.\" Additionally, Dutch has a strong emphasis on vowel length and diphthongs, which can change the meaning of words. For example, \"huis\" (house) and \"huys\" (a variant spelling) are pronounced differently, even though they look similar.\n\n**5. Dutch is closely related to English**\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that Dutch and English share a common Germanic root. In fact, Dutch is more closely related to English than to German! Both languages evolved from Old English and Old Frisian, and many Dutch words are surprisingly similar to English ones. For example, \"water\" in Dutch is pronounced almost identically to English, and \"fiets\" (bicycle) sounds like \"feets.\" This linguistic kinship makes it easier for English speakers to pick up Dutch vocabulary.\n\n**6. Dutch has a formal and informal \"you\"**\n\nLike many European languages, Dutch distinguishes between formal and informal ways of addressing someone. \"U\" is the formal \"you,\" while \"jij\" is the informal \"you.\" This distinction is still widely used in both spoken and written Dutch, especially in professional or polite contexts. Interestingly, in Belgium, \"u\" is used more frequently than in the Netherlands, reflecting cultural differences in formality.\n\n**7. Dutch has a vibrant literary and cultural history**\n\nFrom the 17th-century Golden Age to modern-day authors like Cees Nooteboom and Gerard Reve, Dutch literature has made significant contributions to world culture. The language has also produced iconic films, music, and art. *The Dutch language continues to evolve, embracing new words from English and other languages while maintaining its unique identity.*\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nWhether you're learning Dutch for travel, work, or personal interest, understanding these fascinating facts will deepen your appreciation for the language. With its rich history, expressive vocabulary, and cultural significance, Dutch is more than just a means of communication—it's a window into a vibrant and dynamic society.\n\nSo next time you hear someone say \"Dank je wel\" (Thank you), you'll know there's a whole world of linguistic charm behind those simple words."], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true], "input": "Write a blog post about interesting facts about the Dutch language.

Wilderness areas—untouched, unmanaged, and wild—serve as vital reservoirs of biodiversity, cultural heritage, and ecological balance. These regions are not merely scenic backdrops for recreation; they are living systems that support countless species, regulate climate, and offer sanctuary to both flora and fauna. As we face the escalating threats of climate change, deforestation, and habitat fragmentation, the need to protect these wild places becomes not just an environmental issue, but a moral one.\n\nWilderness preservation is about more than just saving trees or protecting animals. It is about safeguarding the intricate web of life that has evolved over millennia. These areas act as genetic banks, preserving rare and endangered species that may hold the key to future medical breakthroughs or agricultural resilience. Moreover, they provide essential ecosystem services such as clean water filtration, carbon sequestration, and soil stabilization. When we lose a wilderness area, we lose more than just land—we unravel a complex knot of interdependent relationships that sustain life on Earth.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments for wilderness preservation is the intrinsic value of wild places. These areas offer humans a rare opportunity to experience nature in its purest form, away from the noise and artificiality of modern life. They inspire awe, foster spiritual connection, and nurture a sense of humility. In the quiet of a forest or the vastness of a mountain range, people often find clarity and renewal. *This is the essence of what wilderness offers: a chance to reconnect with something greater than ourselves.*\n\nDespite these benefits, wilderness areas continue to face threats from logging, mining, road construction, and climate change. In many regions, development pressures are pushing the boundaries of what can be considered \"wild.\" The challenge lies not only in protecting existing wilderness but also in restoring degraded areas and creating new corridors for wildlife migration. Conservationists and policymakers must work together to ensure that wilderness remains a priority in land-use planning and environmental legislation.\n\nA key aspect of effective preservation is understanding the cultural significance of wilderness to Indigenous communities. For centuries, many Indigenous peoples have lived in harmony with wild landscapes, managing them sustainably through traditional knowledge. Their stewardship offers valuable insights into how we can coexist with nature rather than dominate it. Recognizing and respecting these relationships is essential to any comprehensive preservation strategy.\n\nFurthermore, preserving wilderness is not a static goal but an ongoing process. It requires vigilance, education, and public engagement. As individuals, we can support conservation organizations, advocate for protective policies, and reduce our own environmental footprint. Every effort counts in maintaining the delicate balance of our planet’s ecosystems.\n\nIn conclusion, wilderness preservation is not a luxury—it is a necessity. These wild places are the last strongholds of Earth’s natural heritage, and their protection ensures the survival of countless species, including our own. As we navigate the challenges of the 21st century, we must remember that the health of our planet depends on the health of its wild spaces. Let us not allow the knot of human progress to strangle the very ecosystems that sustain us. *We must choose to preserve, not plunder, the wild places that remain.*"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_level_strict_acc": true, "inst_level_strict_acc": [true, true], "prompt_level_loose_acc": true, "inst_level_loose_acc": [true, true], "input": "Write an essay on wilderness preservation.

Apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge all use similar criteria. Without a unique feature—such as AI-driven compatibility, niche communities, or a focus on meaningful connections—the ad doesn't explain why someone should choose Cohen over competitors.\n\n2. **Weak Branding:** The name \"Cohen\" is not memorable and doesn't convey any sense of personality or purpose. It's a common surname with no inherent meaning or emotional resonance. A strong brand name often hints at the app’s mission or tone (e.g., \"Hinge\" implies building meaningful connections, \"Bumble\" suggests female empowerment). \"Cohen\" offers no such clue.\n\n3. **Vague and Unappealing Messaging:** The line \"find love, friendship, or just someone to swing with\" is problematic. While it attempts to be inclusive, \"swing with\" is ambiguous and could be interpreted as promoting swinging or casual sex, which may alienate users seeking more serious relationships. This phrasing also comes across as flippant and unprofessional, potentially turning off a significant portion of the target audience.\n\n4. **Missing Emotional Hook:** The ad fails to tap into the deeper desires or pain points of its users. People don’t just want to \"meet new people\"—they want connection, understanding, and authenticity. The copy doesn’t evoke emotion or create a sense of aspiration.\n\n5. **Call to Action (CTA) is Weak:** \"Download Cohen today and start meeting new people!\" is a bland, transactional CTA. It doesn’t create urgency or excitement. A stronger CTA would highlight benefits or use action-oriented language that inspires confidence.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n- **Clarify the USP:** What makes Cohen different? Is it better at matching based on personality? Does it prioritize long-term compatibility? Does it have a unique onboarding process? Highlight that.\n- **Rebrand or Recontextualize:** If \"Cohen\" is the actual name, consider adding a tagline that gives it meaning (e.g., \"Cohen: Where Real Connections Begin\").\n- **Tone and Language:** Adjust the tone to match the app’s intended audience. If it’s serious, be sincere. If it’s casual, be playful—but avoid ambiguity.\n- **Stronger CTA:** Try something like, \"Start meaningful conversations today—download Cohen and find your next great connection.\"\n\n**Revised Example:**\n\n<<Find Your Perfect Match with Cohen>>\n\nTired of endless swiping? Cohen uses smart matching based on your values, passions, and location to help you build real connections.
