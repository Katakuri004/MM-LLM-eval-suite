The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky.

It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value.

They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated.

We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nWhich of the following was most directly a cause of the success of the Populist party?\n\nChoices:\nA) Western farmers and ranchers favored conservation and organized to promote the National Parks system.\nB) The growth of corporate power and banking interests inspired rural activists to lobby for political reform.\nC) Western farmers resisted the mechanization of agriculture and resented government interference in rural affairs.\nD) After the Civil War, westward migration slowed, causing a long-term recession in many Western territories.\n\nAnswer:"

He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n—Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nHow did President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the Civil War?\n\nChoices:\nA) The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause.\nB) The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union.\nC) President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves.\nD) The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.\n\nAnswer:"

The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nIn what way did the actions of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 contradict Douglass's sentiments in the excerpt above?\n\nChoices:\nA) Lincoln promoted the freedom of settlers within territories to determine the slave status of their new state.\nB) Lincoln passed the Homestead Act to give free land to all western settlers.\nC) Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from any of the new territories.\nD) Lincoln enacted the policy of giving newly freed slaves \"forty acres and a mule.\"\n\nAnswer:"
