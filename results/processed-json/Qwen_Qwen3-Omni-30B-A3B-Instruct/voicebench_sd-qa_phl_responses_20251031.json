It has a predetermined beginning, middle, and end, usually running for a set number of episodes (often between 100 and 200). Once it concludes, the story is complete, and there are no ongoing storylines.\n   - **Soap Opera**: A soap opera is an ongoing drama series that can run for many years, often with no definitive end. These shows are known for their continuous storylines, with new episodes aired daily or weekly, and characters frequently evolving over time.\n\n2. **Origin and Cultural Context**:\n   - **Telenovela**: Originated in Latin America and is deeply rooted in the region's culture and storytelling traditions. They often feature themes like romance, family drama, and social issues, and are typically produced in Spanish.\n   - **Soap Opera**: Originated in the United States and the United Kingdom, with early examples dating back to the 1930s.
