        "We are given that $ 17_b $ divides $ 97_b $, and we are to find the sum of all integer bases $ b > 9 $ for which this is true.\n\nFirst, convert both numbers from base $ b $ to base 10.\n\n- $ 17_b = 1 \\cdot b + 7 = b + 7 $\n- $ 97_b = 9 \\cdot b + 7 $\n\nWe are told that $ b + 7 $ divides $ 9b + 7 $. So we want:\n\n$$\nb + 7 \\mid 9b + 7\n$$\n\nLet’s perform the division:\n\nWe can write:\n$$\n9b + 7 = q(b + 7) + r\n$$\n\nBut instead, use the divisibility condition: $ b + 7 \\mid 9b + 7 $\n\nLet’s compute the remainder when $ 9b + 7 $ is divided by $ b + 7 $. Use the Euclidean algorithm idea:\n\nLet $ d = b + 7 $. Then $ b = d - 7 $. Substitute into $ 9b + 7 $:\n\n$$\n9b + 7 = 9(d - 7) + 7 = 9d - 63 + 7 = 9d - 56\n$$\n\nSo $ 9b + 7 = 9d - 56 $, and since $ d = b + 7 $, we have:\n\n$$\nb + 7 \\mid 9b + 7 \\iff d \\mid 9d - 56 \\iff d \\mid 56\n$$\n\nBecause $ d \\mid 9d $, so $ d \\mid (9d - 56) $ iff $ d \\mid 56 $.\n\nSo $ b + 7 \\mid 56 $\n\nWe are told $ b > 9 $, so $ b + 7 > 16 $\n\nWe want all divisors $ d $ of 56 such that $ d > 16 $, and $ b = d - 7 $ is an integer base $ > 9 $, which is already satisfied if $ d > 16 $.\n\nList all positive divisors of 56:\n\n$$\n1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56\n$$\n\nNow pick those $ d > 16 $: $ 28, 56 $\n\nSo $ d = 28 \\Rightarrow b = 28 - 7 = 21 $\n\n$ d = 56 \\Rightarrow b = 56 - 7 = 49 $\n\nSo possible $ b $: 21 and 49\n\nNow check if these bases are valid: in base $ b $, digits must be less than $ b $. In $ 17_b $ and $ 97_b $, digits are 9 and 7, so $ b > 9 $, which is satisfied.\n\nSo valid bases: 21 and 49\n\nSum: $ 21 + 49 = 70 $\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{070}"

We are to find the area of a heptagon $ AFNBCEM $, given the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is 288.\n\nLet’s first compute the total lengths of $ AB $ and $ AC $:\n\n- $ AB = AD + DE + EB = 4 + 16 + 8 = 28 $\n- $ AC = AF + FG + GC = 13 + 52 + 26 = 91 $\n\nWe are told:\n- $ M $ is the reflection of $ D $ through $ F $\n- $ N $ is the reflection of $ G $ through $ E $\n- Area of quadrilateral $ DEGF = 288 $\n- We are to find the area of heptagon $ AFNBCEM $\n\nLet’s understand the configuration.\n\nWe are to compute the area of heptagon $ AFNBCEM $. This polygon includes:\n- Points $ A, F, N, B, C, E, M $\n- So it skips $ D $ and $ G $, but includes their reflections $ M $ and $ N $\n\nLet’s consider the full triangle $ ABC $, and subtract the regions not included in the heptagon.\n\nBut perhaps a better idea is to use the given area of quadrilateral $ DEGF = 288 $, and use reflections to find areas of other regions.\n\nLet’s analyze the reflections:\n\n1. $ M $ is the reflection of $ D $ through $ F $. So $ F $ is the midpoint of $ DM $. So $ DF = FM $\n2. $ N $ is the reflection of $ G $ through $ E $. So $ E $ is the midpoint of $ GN $. So $ GE = EN $\n\nWe can use vector geometry or coordinate geometry to compute areas.\n\nLet’s place triangle $ ABC $ on the coordinate plane.\n\nLet’s place point $ A $ at the origin: $ A = (0, 0) $\n\nLet’s place $ AB $ along the x-axis.\n\nSo:\n- $ AB = 28 $, so $ B = (28, 0) $\n- $ AD = 4 $, so $ D = (4, 0) $\n- $ DE = 16 $, so $ E = (4 + 16, 0) = (20, 0) $\n- $ EB = 8 $, so $ B = (28, 0) $, checks out.\n\nNow, $ AC = 91 $, and $ AF = 13 $, $ FG = 52 $, $ GC = 26 $\n\nLet’s suppose $ C = (p, q) $, so $ AC = 91 $, so $ \\sqrt{p^2 + q^2} = 91 $\n\nLet’s define points $ F $ and $ G $ on $ AC $ such that:\n- $ AF = 13 $, so $ F $ divides $ AC $ in ratio $ 13:78 $, since $ AC = 91 $\n- $ AG = AF + FG = 13 + 52 = 65 $, so $ G $ divides $ AC $ in ratio $ 65:26 $\n\nSo:\n- $ F = \\frac{13}{91} C = \\frac{1}{7} C $\n- $ G = \\frac{65}{91} C = \\frac{5}{7} C $\n\nSo $ F = \\left( \\frac{p}{7}, \\frac{q}{7} \\right) $, $ G = \\left( \\frac{5p}{7}, \\frac{5q}{7} \\right) $\n\nNow, $ M $ is the reflection of $ D $ through $ F $\n\nSo $ F $ is the midpoint of $ D $ and $ M $\n\nSo:\n$$\nF = \\frac{D + M}{2} \\Rightarrow M = 2F - D\n$$\n\n$ D = (4, 0) $, $ F = \\left( \\frac{p}{7}, \\frac{q}{7} \\right) $\n\nSo:\n$$\nM = 2 \\left( \\frac{p}{7}, \\frac{q}{7} \\right) - (4, 0) = \\left( \\frac{2p}{7} - 4, \\frac{2q}{7} \\right)\n$$\n\nSimilarly, $ N $ is the reflection of $ G $ through $ E $\n\nSo $ E = (20, 0) $, $ G = \\left( \\frac{5p}{7}, \\frac{5q}{7} \\right) $\n\nThen:\n$$\nN = 2E - G = 2(20, 0) - \\left( \\frac{5p}{7}, \\frac{5q}{7} \\right) = \\left( 40 - \\frac{5p}{7}, -\\frac{5q}{7} \\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we are told that the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ is 288.\n\nLet’s compute the area of quadrilateral $ DEGF $ using coordinates.\n\nPoints:\n- $ D = (4, 0) $\n- $ E = (20, 0) $\n- $ G = \\left( \\frac{5p}{7}, \\frac{5q}{7} \\right) $\n- $ F = \\left( \\frac{p}{7}, \\frac{q}{7} \\right) $\n\nWe can use the shoelace formula.\n\nOrder of points: $ D \\to E \\to G \\to F \\to D $\n\nShoelace:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1) \\right|\n$$\n\nLet’s compute:\n\nLet:\n- $ D = (x_1, y_1) = (4, 0) $\n- $ E = (x_2, y_2) = (20, 0) $\n- $ G = (x_3, y_3) = \\left( \\frac{5p}{7}, \\frac{5q}{7} \\right) $\n- $ F = (x_4, y_4) = \\left( \\frac{p}{7}, \\frac{q}{7} \\right) $\n\nNow compute:\n\nSum1 = $ x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 $\n= $ 4 \\cdot 0 + 20 \\cdot \\frac{5q}{7} + \\frac{5p}{7} \\cdot \\frac{q}{7} + \\frac{p}{7} \\cdot 0 $\n= $ 0 + \\frac{100q}{7} + \\frac{5pq}{49} + 0 $\n\nSum2 = $ y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1 $\n= $ 0 \\cdot 20 + 0 \\cdot \\frac{5p}{7} + \\frac{5q}{7} \\cdot \\frac{p}{7} + \\frac{q}{7} \\cdot 4 $\n= $ 0 + 0 + \\frac{5pq}{49} + \\frac{4q}{7} $\n\nSo area:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\left( \\frac{100q}{7} + \\frac{5pq}{49} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{5pq}{49} + \\frac{4q}{7} \\right) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\frac{100q}{7} - \\frac{4q}{7} \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{96q}{7} = \\frac{48q}{7}\n$$\n\nWe are told this area is 288:\n\n$$\n\\frac{48q}{7} = 288 \\Rightarrow q = \\frac{288 \\cdot 7}{48} = 6 \\cdot 7 = 42\n$$\n\nSo $ q = 42 $\n\nNow, since $ AC = 91 $, and $ C = (p, q) = (p, 42) $, so:\n\n$$\np^2 + 42^2 = 91^2 \\Rightarrow p^2 + 1764 = 8281 \\Rightarrow p^2 = 8281 - 1764 = 6517\n$$\n\nWait, 91² = 8281? Let's check:\n\n$ 90^2 = 8100 $, $ 91^2 = 8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281 $, yes.\n\n$ 42^2 = 1764 $, yes.\n\nSo $ p^2 = 8281 - 1764 = 6517 $\n\nBut 6517 is not a perfect square? Wait, but we don't need $ p $ explicitly, because we can compute areas using vectors or coordinates.\n\nBut we can proceed.\n\nWe now know $ q = 42 $, so $ C = (p, 42) $, $ p^2 = 6517 $\n\nBut we can compute the area of triangle $ ABC $:\n\nArea of $ \\triangle ABC $ = $ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB \\cdot h $, where $ h $ is the height from $ C $ to $ AB $. Since $ AB $ is on x-axis, height is $ |q| = 42 $\n\nSo area $ = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 28 \\cdot 42 = 14 \\cdot 42 = 588 $\n\nSo area of $ \\triangle ABC = 588 $\n\nNow, we are to find the area of heptagon $ AFNBCEM $\n\nLet’s list the vertices in order: $ A \\to F \\to N \\to B \\to C \\to E \\to M \\to A $\n\nWe can compute this area using shoelace formula, but we need coordinates.\n\nWe already have:\n- $ A = (0, 0) $\n- $ F = \\left( \\frac{p}{7}, \\frac{42}{7} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{p}{7}, 6 \\right) $\n- $ N = \\left( 40 - \\frac{5p}{7}, -\\frac{5 \\cdot 42}{7} \\right) = \\left( 40 - \\frac{5p}{7}, -30 \\right) $\n- $ B = (28, 0) $\n- $ C = (p, 42) $\n- $ E = (20, 0) $\n- $ M = \\left( \\frac{2p}{7} - 4, \\frac{2 \\cdot 42}{7} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{2p}{7} - 4, 12 \\right) $\n\nNow, we can compute the area of heptagon $ AFNBCEM $ using shoelace formula.\n\nLet’s list the points in order:\n\n1. $ A = (0, 0) $\n2. $ F = \\left( \\frac{p}{7}, 6 \\right) $\n3. $ N = \\left( 40 - \\frac{5p}{7}, -30 \\right) $\n4. $ B = (28, 0) $\n5. $ C = (p, 42) $\n6. $ E = (20, 0) $\n7. $ M = \\left( \\frac{2p}{7} - 4, 12 \\right) $\n8. Back to $ A = (0, 0) $\n\nNow, shoelace formula:\n\nArea = $ \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum_{i=1}^7 (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) \\right| $\n\nLet’s compute each term $ x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i $\n\nLet’s denote $ x_i, y_i $ for each point.\n\nLet’s compute term by term.\n\nLet $ a = \\frac{p}{7} $, so $ p = 7a $\n\nThen:\n- $ F = (a, 6) $\n- $ N = (40 - 5a, -30) $\n- $ C = (7a, 42) $\n- $ M = (2a - 4, 12) $\n\nNow compute:\n\n1. $ i = 1 $: $ A = (0,0) $, $ F = (a,6) $\n   $ x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1 = 0 \\cdot 6 - a \\cdot 0 = 0 $\n\n2. $ i = 2 $: $ F = (a,6) $, $ N = (40 - 5a, -30) $\n   $ x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2 = a \\cdot (-30) - (40 - 5a) \\cdot 6 = -30a - 240 + 30a = -240 $\n\n3. $ i = 3 $: $ N = (40 - 5a, -30) $, $ B = (28, 0) $\n   $ x_3 y_4 - x_4 y_3 = (40 - 5a) \\cdot 0 - 28 \\cdot (-30) = 0 + 840 = 840 $\n\n4. $ i = 4 $: $ B = (28,0) $, $ C = (7a,42) $\n   $ x_4 y_5 - x_5 y_4 = 28 \\cdot 42 - 7a \\cdot 0 = 1176 - 0 = 1176 $\n\n5. $ i = 5 $: $ C = (7a,42) $, $ E = (20,0) $\n   $ x_5 y_6 - x_6 y_5 = 7a \\cdot 0 - 20 \\cdot 42 = 0 - 840 = -840 $\n\n6. $ i = 6 $: $ E = (20,0) $, $ M = (2a - 4, 12) $\n   $ x_6 y_7 - x_7 y_6 = 20 \\cdot 12 - (2a - 4) \\cdot 0 = 240 - 0 = 240 $\n\n7. $ i = 7 $: $ M = (2a - 4, 12) $, $ A = (0,0) $\n   $ x_7 y_8 - x_8 y_7 = (2a - 4) \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 12 = 0 $\n\nNow sum all terms:\n$$\n0 + (-240) + 840 + 1176 + (-840) + 240 + 0 = (-240 - 840) + (840 + 1176 + 240) = (-1080) + (2256) = 1176\n$$\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\n- Start: 0\n- + (-240) → -240\n- + 840 → 600\n- + 1176 → 1776\n- + (-840) → 936\n- + 240 → 1176\n- + 0 → 1176\n\nSo total sum = 1176\n\nThen area = $ \\frac{1}{2} |1176| = 588 $\n\nBut that’s the same as area of triangle $ ABC $. But the heptagon is inside the triangle? But we have points $ M $ and $ N $ that are outside?\n\nWait, $ M $ is reflection of $ D $ through $ F $. $ D $ is on $ AB $, $ F $ is on $ AC $, so $ M $ is likely outside the triangle.\n\nSimilarly, $ N $ is reflection of $ G $ through $ E $, $ G $ on $ AC $, $ E $ on $ AB $, so $ N $ is likely outside.\n\nSo the heptagon $ AFNBCEM $ may extend outside triangle $ ABC $, so its area could be larger than 588.\n\nBut we got 588, which is the area of $ ABC $. But that can't be right because the heptagon includes points outside.\n\nWait, but in our shoelace calculation, we got sum of $ x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i = 1176 $, so area = $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1176 = 588 $\n\nBut that suggests the area is 588, same as triangle $ ABC $. But that seems suspicious.\n\nWait, let’s double-check the shoelace terms.\n\nLet me recompute carefully.\n\nList of points:\n\n1. $ A = (0, 0) $\n2. $ F = (a, 6) $\n3. $ N = (40 - 5a, -30) $\n4. $ B = (28, 0) $\n5. $ C = (7a, 42) $\n6. $ E = (20, 0) $\n7. $ M = (2a - 4, 12) $\n8. $ A = (0, 0) $\n\nNow compute $ x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i $ for $ i = 1 $ to $ 7 $\n\n1. $ i="

We look for two binomials:\n\n$$\n(ax + by)(cx + dy) = 12x^2 - xy - 6y^2\n$$\n\nWe want $ac = 12$, $bd = -6$, and $ad + bc = -1$ (coefficient of $xy$).\n\nTry factoring:\n\nTry $(3x + 2y)(4x - 3y)$:\n\n$$\n(3x + 2y)(4x - 3y) = 12x^2 -9xy + 8xy -6y^2 = 12x^2 - xy -6y^2\n$$\n\nYes! That matches.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n12x^2 - xy - 6y^2 = (3x + 2y)(4x - 3y) = 0\n$$\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n$$\n(3x + 2y)(4x - 3y) = 0\n$$\n\nThus, either:\n\n1. $3x + 2y = 0$, or  \n2. $4x - 3y = 0$\n\nWe now solve each case for integer solutions $(x, y)$ in $[-100, 100]$.\n\n---\n\n### Case 1: $3x + 2y = 0$\n\nThen $y = -\\frac{3}{2}x$\n\nWe want $x, y$ integers, so $x$ must be even.\n\nLet $x = 2k$, then $y = -\\frac{3}{2}(2k) = -3k$\n\nSo $x = 2k$, $y = -3k$\n\nNow $-100 \\leq x = 2k \\leq 100$ → $-50 \\leq k \\leq 50$\n\nSo $k$ ranges from $-50$ to $50$, inclusive → $101$ values\n\nFor each such $k$, $y = -3k$, and we must check if $y \\in [-100, 100]$\n\nLet’s check bounds:\n\n- $k = -50$: $y = -3(-50) = 150$ → too big\n- $k = 50$: $y = -150$ → too small\n\nSo we need $-100 \\leq -3k \\leq 100$\n\nMultiply by $-1$ (reverse inequalities):\n\n$$\n-100 \\leq -3k \\leq 100 \\Rightarrow -100 \\leq -3k \\leq 100\n\\Rightarrow -100 \\leq -3k \\Rightarrow k \\leq \\frac{100}{3} \\approx 33.33\n\\Rightarrow k \\leq 33\n$$\n$$\n-3k \\leq 100 \\Rightarrow k \\geq -\\frac{100}{3} \\approx -33.33 \\Rightarrow k \\geq -33\n$$\n\nSo $k \\in [-33, 33]$, inclusive\n\nNow check $x = 2k$: $k = -33$: $x = -66$, $k = 33$: $x = 66$, both in $[-100, 100]$\n\nSo $k$ from $-33$ to $33$: total $33 - (-33) + 1 = 67$ values\n\nSo 67 solutions from this case.\n\n---\n\n### Case 2: $4x - 3y = 0$\n\nThen $y = \\frac{4}{3}x$\n\nSo $x$ must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet $x = 3m$, then $y = \\frac{4}{3}(3m) = 4m$\n\nSo $x = 3m$, $y = 4m$\n\nNow $-100 \\leq x = 3m \\leq 100$ → $-\\frac{100}{3} \\leq m \\leq \\frac{100}{3}$ → $-33.33 \\leq m \\leq 33.33$\n\nSo $m \\in [-33, 33]$\n\nNow check $y = 4m$: $m = -33$: $y = -132$ → too small  \n$m = 33$: $y = 132$ → too big\n\nSo we need $-100 \\leq 4m \\leq 100$\n\nSo $-25 \\leq m \\leq 25$\n\nBecause $4m \\geq -100$ → $m \\geq -25$, $4m \\leq 100$ → $m \\leq 25$\n\nSo $m \\in [-25, 25]$\n\nNow check $x = 3m$: $m = -25$: $x = -75$, $m = 25$: $x = 75$, both in $[-100, 100]$\n\nSo $m$ from $-25$ to $25$: total $25 - (-25) + 1 = 51$ values\n\nSo 51 solutions from this case.\n\n---\n\n### Total solutions?\n\nWe have:\n\n- Case 1: 67 solutions\n- Case 2: 51 solutions\n\nBut we must check if there is **overlap** — that is, any $(x, y)$ satisfying both equations.\n\nSuppose both $3x + 2y = 0$ and $4x - 3y = 0$\n\nThen solve the system:\n\nFrom first: $y = -\\frac{3}{2}x$\n\nPlug into second: $4x - 3(-\\frac{3}{2}x) = 4x + \\frac{9}{2}x = \\frac{17}{2}x = 0$ → $x = 0$, then $y = 0$\n\nSo only common solution is $(0, 0)$\n\nSo we must subtract 1 if we double-counted it.\n\nBut in our counting:\n\n- Case 1: $k = 0$: $x = 0$, $y = 0$\n- Case 2: $m = 0$: $x = 0$, $y = 0$\n\nSo $(0,0)$ is counted in both.\n\nSo total number of **distinct** solutions is:\n\n$$\n67 + 51 - 1 = 117\n$$\n\n---\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{117}$"

        "We are given a system of two equations involving a complex number $ z $ and a real number $ k $:\n\n1. $ |25 + 20i - z| = 5 $\n2. $ |z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k| $\n\nWe are told that this system has **exactly one** complex solution $ z $, and we are to find the **sum of all possible values of $ k $** for which this happens. Then express that sum as $ \\frac{m}{n} $, reduced, and compute $ m+n $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Interpret the equations geometrically\n\nLet $ z = x + yi $, with $ x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} $.\n\n#### First equation:\n$$\n|25 + 20i - z| = 5\n$$\nThis is the set of points $ z $ in the complex plane at distance 5 from $ 25 + 20i $. So it's a **circle** centered at $ (25, 20) $ with radius 5.\n\n#### Second equation:\n$$\n|z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k|\n$$\nLet’s write this as:\n$$\n|z - (k + 4)| = |z - (k + 3i)|\n$$\nThis is the set of points equidistant from $ k + 4 $ and $ k + 3i $. That is, the **perpendicular bisector** of the segment joining $ (k, 0) + (4, 0) = (k+4, 0) $ and $ (k, 0) + (0, 3) = (k, 3) $.\n\nSo the two points are:\n- $ A = (k+4, 0) $\n- $ B = (k, 3) $\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of $ AB $ is the set of points equidistant from $ A $ and $ B $.\n\nLet’s find the equation of this bisector.\n\nMidpoint of $ AB $:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{(k+4) + k}{2}, \\frac{0 + 3}{2} \\right) = \\left( k + 2, \\frac{3}{2} \\right)\n$$\n\nDirection vector of $ AB $: $ (k - (k+4), 3 - 0) = (-4, 3) $\n\nSo the perpendicular bisector has direction vector $ (3, 4) $ (since $ (-4,3) \\cdot (3,4) = -12 + 12 = 0 $)\n\nSo the perpendicular bisector is the line through $ (k+2, 3/2) $ with direction $ (3,4) $, or slope $ \\frac{4}{3} $.\n\nSo the equation is:\n$$\ny - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{4}{3}(x - (k+2))\n$$\n\nWe can write this as:\n$$\ny = \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{4}{3}(k+2) + \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n\nNow, the first equation is a circle:\n$$\n(x - 25)^2 + (y - 20)^2 = 25\n$$\n\nWe want the **intersection** of this circle and the line to have **exactly one point** — that is, the line is tangent to the circle.\n\nSo we substitute the expression for $ y $ from the line into the circle and require that the resulting quadratic in $ x $ has **exactly one solution** — discriminant zero.\n\nLet’s do that.\n\nLet:\n$$\ny = \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{4}{3}(k+2) + \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n\nLet’s simplify the constant term:\n$$\n-\\frac{4}{3}(k+2) + \\frac{3}{2} = -\\frac{4k}{3} - \\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{3}{2} = -\\frac{4k}{3} + \\left( -\\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{3}{2} \\right)\n$$\n\nCompute $ -\\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{-16 + 9}{6} = -\\frac{7}{6} $\n\nSo:\n$$\ny = \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{4k}{3} - \\frac{7}{6}\n$$\n\nNow plug into the circle:\n$$\n(x - 25)^2 + \\left( \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{4k}{3} - \\frac{7}{6} - 20 \\right)^2 = 25\n$$\n\nSimplify the $ y $-term:\n$$\n\\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{4k}{3} - \\frac{7}{6} - 20 = \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{4k}{3} - \\frac{7}{6} - \\frac{120}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{4k}{3} - \\frac{127}{6}\n$$\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n$$\n(x - 25)^2 + \\left( \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{4k}{3} - \\frac{127}{6} \\right)^2 = 25\n$$\n\nLet’s write everything with common denominators to simplify.\n\nLet’s multiply the entire equation by $ 36 $ to eliminate denominators.\n\nFirst, expand each term.\n\nLet’s denote:\n$$\nA = (x - 25)^2 = x^2 - 50x + 625\n$$\n\n$$\nB = \\left( \\frac{4}{3}x - \\frac{4k}{3} - \\frac{127}{6} \\right)^2\n$$\n\nLet’s write $ B $ as:\n$$\n= \\left( \\frac{8x - 8k - 127}{6} \\right)^2 = \\frac{(8x - 8k - 127)^2}{36}\n$$\n\nSo the equation is:\n$$\nx^2 - 50x + 625 + \\frac{(8x - 8k - 127)^2}{36} = 25\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 36:\n$$\n36(x^2 - 50x + 625) + (8x - 8k - 127)^2 = 900\n$$\n\nCompute:\n$$\n36x^2 - 1800x + 22500 + (8x - 8k - 127)^2 = 900\n$$\n\nNow expand $ (8x - 8k - 127)^2 $:\nLet $ u = 8x - 8k - 127 $\n\nThen:\n$$\nu^2 = 64x^2 + 64k^2 + 16129 - 128k x - 2032x + 2032k\n$$\n\nWait, better to expand directly:\n$$\n(8x - 8k - 127)^2 = (8x)^2 + (-8k)^2 + (-127)^2 + 2(8x)(-8k) + 2(8x)(-127) + 2(-8k)(-127)\n$$\n$$\n= 64x^2 + 64k^2 + 16129 - 128k x - 2032x + 2032k\n$$\n\nSo total:\n$$\n36x^2 - 1800x + 22500 + 64x^2 + 64k^2 + 16129 - 128k x - 2032x + 2032k = 900\n$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- $ x^2 $: $ 36 + 64 = 100x^2 $\n- $ x $: $ -1800 - 2032 = -3832 $, and $ -128k x $ → total: $ -128k x - 3832x $\n- constants: $ 22500 + 16129 = 38629 $, plus $ 64k^2 + 2032k $\n- RHS: 900\n\nSo:\n$$\n100x^2 + (-128k - 3832)x + (64k^2 + 2032k + 38629) = 900\n$$\n\nBring 900 to left:\n$$\n100x^2 + (-128k - 3832)x + (64k^2 + 2032k + 37729) = 0\n$$\n\nThis is a quadratic in $ x $. For the system to have **exactly one solution**, this quadratic must have **exactly one real root**, so discriminant $ D = 0 $.\n\nSo compute discriminant:\n$$\nD = [ -128k - 3832 ]^2 - 4 \\cdot 100 \\cdot (64k^2 + 2032k + 37729) = 0\n$$\n\nLet’s compute this.\n\nLet $ A = -128k - 3832 $, so $ A^2 = (128k + 3832)^2 $\n\nCompute:\n$$\n(128k + 3832)^2 = 128^2 k^2 + 2 \\cdot 128 \\cdot 3832 k + 3832^2\n$$\n\nCompute:\n- $ 128^2 = 16384 $\n- $ 2 \\cdot 128 \\cdot 3832 = 256 \\cdot 3832 $\n\nCompute $ 256 \\cdot 3832 $:\n\nBreak it:\n$ 256 \\cdot 3832 = 256 \\cdot (3800 + 32) = 256 \\cdot 3800 + 256 \\cdot 32 $\n\n- $ 256 \\cdot 3800 = 256 \\cdot 38 \\cdot 100 = (256 \\cdot 38) \\cdot 100 $\n  - $ 256 \\cdot 38 = 256 \\cdot (40 - 2) = 10240 - 512 = 9728 $\n  - So $ 9728 \\cdot 100 = 972800 $\n- $ 256 \\cdot 32 = 8192 $\n- Total: $ 972800 + 8192 = 980992 $\n\nSo $ 2 \\cdot 128 \\cdot 3832 = 980992 $\n\nNow $ 3832^2 $:\n\nNote: $ 3832 = 3800 + 32 $\n\nSo:\n$$\n(3800 + 32)^2 = 3800^2 + 2 \\cdot 3800 \\cdot 32 + 32^2\n$$\n- $ 3800^2 = 14,440,000 $\n- $ 2 \\cdot 3800 \\cdot 32 = 7600 \\cdot 32 = 243,200 $\n- $ 32^2 = 1024 $\n- Total: $ 14,440,000 + 243,200 = 14,683,200 + 1024 = 14,684,224 $\n\nSo $ A^2 = 16384k^2 + 980992k + 14,684,224 $\n\nNow compute $ 4 \\cdot 100 \\cdot (64k^2 + 2032k + 37729) = 400 \\cdot (64k^2 + 2032k + 37729) $\n\nCompute:\n- $ 400 \\cdot 64k^2 = 25600k^2 $\n- $ 400 \\cdot 2032k = 812,800k $\n- $ 400 \\cdot 37729 = 15,091,600 $\n\nSo discriminant:\n$$\nD = (16384k^2 + 980992k + 14,684,224) - (25600k^2 + 812800k + 15,091,600) = 0\n$$\n\nCompute:\n- $ k^2 $: $ 16384 - 25600 = -9216 $\n- $ k $: $ 980992 - 812800 = 168192 $\n- constant: $ 14,684,224 - 15,091,600 = -407,376 $\n\nSo:\n$$\n-9216k^2 + 168192k - 407376 = 0\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by $ -1 $:\n$$\n9216k^2 - 168192k + 407376 = 0\n$$\n\nNow divide all terms by 48 to simplify.\n\nCheck GCD of coefficients.\n\nFirst, divide by 48:\n- $ 9216 \\div 48 = 192 $\n- $ 168192 \\div 48 = 3504 $\n- $ 407376 \\div 48 = 8487 $\n\nWait, maybe divide by 16 first.\n\nTry dividing by 48:\n- $ 9216 \\div 48 = 192 $\n- $ 168192 \\div 48 = 3504 $\n- $ 407376 \\div 48 = 8487 $\n\nCheck if 192, 3504, 8487 have common factor.\n\nTry dividing by 3:\n- $ 192 \\div 3 = 64 $\n- $ 3504 \\div 3 = 1168 $\n- $ 8487 \\div 3 = 2829 $\n\nAgain:\n- $ 64 $: no\n- $ 1168 \\div 3 = 389.333 $ → not divisible\n\nSo divide by 3 once:\n$$\n3072k^2 - 56064k + 135792 = 0 \\quad \\text{(after multiplying by 3)}\n$$\n\nWait, better to divide original equation by 48:\n\nOriginal:\n$$\n9216k^2 - 168192k + 407376 = 0\n$$\n\nDivide by 48:\n- $ 9216 / 48 = 192 $\n- $ 168192 / 48 = 3504 $\n- $ 407376 / 48 = 8487 $\n\nSo:\n$$\n192k^2 - 3504k + 8487 = 0\n$$\n\nNow divide by 3:\n- $ 192 / 3 = 64 $\n- $ 3504 / 3 = 1168 $\n- $ 8487 / 3 = 2829 $\n\nSo:\n$$\n64k^2 - 1168k + 2829 = 0\n$$\n\nNow check if this can be simplified further.\n\nCheck GCD of 64, 1168, 2829.\n\n64 and 1168: 1168 ÷ 64 = 18.25 → not divisible.\n\nGCD of 64 and 1168: 64 = 2^6, 1168 ÷ 16 = 73 → 1168 = 16 × 73 → GCD = 16\n\nBut 2829 ÷ 16? 2829 ÷ 16 = 176.8125 → not divisible.\n\nSo GCD of all three: check GCD(64,1168,2829)\n\nGCD(64,1168) = 16\n\nGCD(16,2829): 2829 ÷ 16 = 176.8125 → remainder 2829 - 176×16 = 2829 - 2816 = 13 → GCD(16,13) = 1\n\nSo no common factor.\n\nSo quadratic is:\n$$\n64k^2 - 1168k + 2829 = 0\n$$\n\nWe want the **sum of all possible values of $ k $** for which the system has exactly one solution.\n\nBut this quadratic gives the values of $ k $ for which the discriminant is zero — that is, the line is tangent to the circle"

        "We are given the parabola $ y = x^2 - 4 $, which is rotated $ 60^\\circ $ counterclockwise about the origin. We are to find the $ y $-coordinate of the unique intersection point in the fourth quadrant between the original parabola and its rotated image. The answer is to be expressed in the form $ \\frac{a - \\sqrt{b}}{c} $, and we are to compute $ a + b + c $.\n\nLet’s denote the original parabola as $ P: y = x^2 - 4 $. After rotating the entire plane $ 60^\\circ $ counterclockwise about the origin, the image of the parabola is the set of points $ (x', y') $ such that the pre-image $ (x, y) $ lies on $ P $, and $ (x', y') $ is the rotation of $ (x, y) $ by $ 60^\\circ $.\n\nThe rotation transformation is:\n$$\nx' = x \\cos 60^\\circ - y \\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y\n$$\n$$\ny' = x \\sin 60^\\circ + y \\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \\frac{1}{2}y\n$$\n\nWe want the image of the parabola $ y = x^2 - 4 $ under this rotation. So, for each point $ (x, y) $ on the parabola, we compute $ (x', y') $, and we want the equation of the rotated curve in terms of $ x' $ and $ y' $. But we are interested in the intersection of the original parabola and the rotated parabola.\n\nLet $ (x, y) $ be a point that lies on both the original parabola and the rotated image. That is:\n- $ y = x^2 - 4 $ (on original)\n- $ (x, y) $ is the image of some point $ (u, v) $ on the original parabola under a $ -60^\\circ $ rotation (since the rotated parabola is the image of the original under $ +60^\\circ $, so to find points on the rotated parabola, we rotate points on the original by $ +60^\\circ $; so a point $ (x, y) $ lies on the rotated parabola iff its pre-image under $ +60^\\circ $ rotation lies on the original parabola).\n\nSo, to find the rotated parabola, we take a point $ (u, v) $ on $ v = u^2 - 4 $, rotate it $ 60^\\circ $ to get $ (x, y) $, and eliminate $ u, v $ to get the equation of the rotated curve.\n\nLet’s do that.\n\nLet $ (x, y) $ be the image of $ (u, v) $ under $ 60^\\circ $ rotation:\n$$\nx = \\frac{1}{2}u - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}v, \\quad y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}u + \\frac{1}{2}v\n$$\nWe want to eliminate $ u, v $, given $ v = u^2 - 4 $.\n\nWe solve the system:\n$$\nx = \\frac{1}{2}u - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(u^2 - 4)\n$$\n$$\ny = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}u + \\frac{1}{2}(u^2 - 4)\n$$\n\nBut we can instead express $ u $ and $ v $ in terms of $ x $ and $ y $, using the inverse rotation.\n\nThe inverse rotation (i.e., $ -60^\\circ $) is:\n$$\nu = x \\cos(-60^\\circ) - y \\sin(-60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y\n$$\n$$\nv = x \\sin(-60^\\circ) + y \\cos(-60^\\circ) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \\frac{1}{2}y\n$$\n\nSince $ (u, v) $ lies on the original parabola $ v = u^2 - 4 $, we substitute:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \\frac{1}{2}y = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y \\right)^2 - 4\n$$\n\nNow expand both sides.\n\nLeft-hand side:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \\frac{1}{2}y\n$$\n\nRight-hand side:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y \\right)^2 - 4 = \\frac{1}{4}x^2 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}xy + \\frac{3}{4}y^2 - 4 = \\frac{1}{4}x^2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}xy + \\frac{3}{4}y^2 - 4\n$$\n\nSo the equation is:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \\frac{1}{2}y = \\frac{1}{4}x^2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}xy + \\frac{3}{4}y^2 - 4\n$$\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n$$\n-2\\sqrt{3}x + 2y = x^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}xy + 3y^2 - 16\n$$\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n$$\nx^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}xy + 3y^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}x - 2y - 16 = 0\n$$\n\nThis is the equation of the rotated parabola.\n\nNow, we want to find the intersection points of this rotated parabola with the original $ y = x^2 - 4 $.\n\nSubstitute $ y = x^2 - 4 $ into the rotated equation.\n\nSo:\n$$\nx^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}x(x^2 - 4) + 3(x^2 - 4)^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}x - 2(x^2 - 4) - 16 = 0\n$$\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. $ x^2 $\n2. $ 2\\sqrt{3}x(x^2 - 4) = 2\\sqrt{3}x^3 - 8\\sqrt{3}x $\n3. $ 3(x^2 - 4)^2 = 3(x^4 - 8x^2 + 16) = 3x^4 - 24x^2 + 48 $\n4. $ 2\\sqrt{3}x $\n5. $ -2(x^2 - 4) = -2x^2 + 8 $\n6. $ -16 $\n\nNow sum all:\n\n- $ x^2 $\n- $ 2\\sqrt{3}x^3 - 8\\sqrt{3}x $\n- $ 3x^4 - 24x^2 + 48 $\n- $ 2\\sqrt{3}x $\n- $ -2x^2 + 8 $\n- $ -16 $\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- $ x^4 $: $ 3x^4 $\n- $ x^3 $: $ 2\\sqrt{3}x^3 $\n- $ x^2 $: $ x^2 - 24x^2 - 2x^2 = -25x^2 $\n- $ x $: $ -8\\sqrt{3}x + 2\\sqrt{3}x = -6\\sqrt{3}x $\n- constants: $ 48 + 8 - 16 = 40 $\n\nSo the equation is:\n$$\n3x^4 + 2\\sqrt{3}x^3 - 25x^2 - 6\\sqrt{3}x + 40 = 0\n$$\n\nWe now solve this quartic equation. Since we are told there is a unique intersection point in the fourth quadrant, and the original parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, and rotation breaks symmetry, we expect a finite number of solutions.\n\nLet’s try to factor this equation. It has irrational coefficients, so perhaps we can factor it into quadratics.\n\nAssume:\n$$\n(3x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d) = 3x^4 + (3c + a)x^3 + (3d + ac + b)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd\n$$\n\nWe want:\n- $ 3c + a = 2\\sqrt{3} $\n- $ 3d + ac + b = -25 $\n- $ ad + bc = -6\\sqrt{3} $\n- $ bd = 40 $\n\nTry to guess $ b $ and $ d $ such that $ bd = 40 $.

So $ f $ is periodic with period 4.\n\nWe are also given a parabola: $ x = 34y^2 $, and we are to find the sum of the $ y $-coordinates of the points where this parabola intersects the graph of $ f(x) $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the function $ f(x) $\n\nThe function is defined on $ [-1, 3) $, and then repeated every 4 units.\n\nLet’s understand the shape of $ f(x) $ on one period.\n\nOn $ [-1, 1) $: $ f(x) = x $\n\nOn $ [1, 3) $: $ f(x) = 2 - x $\n\nSo on $ [-1, 3) $, the graph is:\n\n- From $ x = -1 $ to $ x = 1 $: line from $ (-1, -1) $ to $ (1, 1) $\n- From $ x = 1 $ to $ x = 3 $: line from $ (1, 1) $ to $ (3, -1) $\n\nThen it repeats every 4 units.\n\nSo the function is a **sawtooth wave** with period 4, going from $ (-1, -1) $ to $ (1, 1) $, then down to $ (3, -1) $, then repeats.\n\nSo the full graph consists of repeated \"V\" shapes, each of width 4, with peaks at $ x = 1, 5, 9, \\dots $ and troughs at $ x = 3, 7, 11, \\dots $, and also at $ x = -1, -5, \\dots $\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: The parabola $ x = 34y^2 $\n\nThis is a rightward-opening parabola. For each $ y $, $ x = 34y^2 \\geq 0 $. So the parabola lies entirely in $ x \\geq 0 $.\n\nWe are to find the intersection points between $ x = 34y^2 $ and $ y = f(x) $.\n\nBut $ f(x) $ is a function of $ x $, so we want points $ (x, y) $ such that:\n\n- $ y = f(x) $\n- $ x = 34y^2 $\n\nSo substitute $ y = f(x) $ into the second equation:\n\n$$\nx = 34[f(x)]^2\n$$\n\nWe are to solve this equation for $ x $, and then sum the $ y $-values $ f(x) $ at the solutions.\n\nBut since $ f(x) $ is periodic with period 4, and $ x = 34y^2 $ grows without bound, we expect only finitely many intersections.\n\nLet’s find all $ x $ such that $ x = 34[f(x)]^2 $.\n\nLet’s consider one period of $ f(x) $, say $ x \\in [-1, 3) $, and then extend periodically.\n\nBut since $ x = 34y^2 \\geq 0 $, we only need to consider $ x \\geq 0 $. So we can restrict to $ x \\in [0, 3) $, and then $ x \\in [4, 7) $, $ x \\in [8, 11) $, etc., since $ f(x) $ is periodic with period 4.\n\nSo we consider intervals $ [4k, 4k+4) $ for $ k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $, but only where $ x \\geq 0 $.\n\nBut $ x = 34y^2 $, and $ y = f(x) $, and $ f(x) \\in [-1, 1] $, so $ y^2 \\leq 1 $, so $ x = 34y^2 \\leq 34 $. So $ x \\in [0, 34] $.\n\nSo we only need to consider $ x \\in [0, 34] $, and since $ f $ has period 4, we can consider $ k = 0 $ to $ k = 8 $, since $ 4 \\times 8 = 32 $, $ 4 \\times 9 = 36 > 34 $.\n\nSo $ x \\in [0, 34] $, and $ f(x) $ is defined piecewise on each interval $ [4k, 4k+4) $.\n\nBut we need to define $ f(x) $ on each interval $ [4k, 4k+4) $.\n\nWe know $ f(x) $ is defined on $ [-1, 3) $, and $ f(x+4) = f(x) $, so:\n\nFor $ x \\in [4k - 1, 4k + 3) $, $ f(x) = f(x - 4k) $\n\nSo for $ x \\in [4k, 4k+4) $, we can write $ f(x) = f(x - 4k) $, and $ x - 4k \\in [0, 4) $\n\nBut $ f $ is defined on $ [-1, 3) $, so $ x - 4k \\in [0, 3) $ is fine, but $ x - 4k \\in [3, 4) $ is not in the original domain.\n\nWait: the original definition is on $ [-1, 1) $ and $ [1, 3) $, so $ [-1, 3) $, and then $ f(x+4) = f(x) $, so $ f $ is defined on $ [-1 + 4k, 3 + 4k) $ for each integer $ k $.\n\nSo for $ x \\in [4k - 1, 4k + 3) $, $ f(x) = f(x - 4k) $\n\nSo for $ x \\in [4k, 4k+4) $, we need to consider $ x - 4k \\in [0, 4) $, but $ f $ is only defined on $ [-1, 3) $, so $ x - 4k \\in [0, 3) $ is fine, but $ x - 4k \\in [3, 4) $ is not in the domain.\n\nBut $ f(x) $ is defined on $ [4k - 1, 4k + 3) $, so for $ x \\in [4k, 4k + 3) $, $ f(x) = f(x - 4k) $, and for $ x \\in [4k + 3, 4k + 4) $, $ x - 4k \\in [3, 4) $, which is not in $ [-1, 3) $, so we need to use periodicity.\n\nWait: $ f(x+4) = f(x) $, so $ f(x) = f(x - 4k) $ for any integer $ k $, as long as $ x - 4k \\in [-1, 3) $\n\nSo for $ x \\in [4k, 4k + 4) $, $ x - 4k \\in [0, 4) $, but $ f $ is only defined on $ [-1, 3) $, so $ x - 4k \\in [0, 3) $ is fine, but $ x - 4k \\in [3, 4) $ is not in the domain.\n\nBut $ f(x) = f(x - 4k) $ only if $ x - 4k \\in [-1, 3) $. So for $ x \\in [4k + 3, 4k + 4) $, $ x - 4k \\in [3, 4) $, which is not in $ [-1, 3) $, so we need to shift by $ -4 $ again.\n\nSo $ f(x) = f(x - 4k) $, but $ x - 4k \\in [3, 4) $, so $ x - 4k - 4 \\in [-1, 0) $, which is in $ [-1, 3) $, so $ f(x) = f(x - 4k - 4) $\n\nSo for $ x \\in [4k + 3, 4k + 4) $, $ f(x) = f(x - 4k - 4) = f(x - 4(k+1)) $\n\nBut $ x - 4(k+1) \\in [-1, 0) $, and on $ [-1, 0) $, $ f(x) = x $, since $ -1 \\leq x < 1 $\n\nSo in summary:\n\nFor $ x \\in [4k, 4k + 1) $: $ f(x) = x - 4k $\n\nFor $ x \\in [4k + 1, 4k + 3) $: $ f(x) = 2 - (x - 4k) $\n\nFor $ x \\in [4k + 3, 4k + 4) $: $ f(x) = x - 4k - 4 $\n\nBecause $ x - 4k \\in [3, 4) $, so $ x - 4k - 4 \\in [-1, 0) $, and $ f(x) = f(x - 4k - 4) = x - 4k - 4 $\n\nSo we can write:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \n\\begin{cases}\nx - 4k & \\text{if } 4k \\leq x < 4k + 1 \\\\\n2 - (x - 4k) & \\text{if } 4k + 1 \\leq x < 4k + 3 \\\\\nx - 4k - 4 & \\text{if } 4k + 3 \\leq x < 4k + 4\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow, we want to solve $ x = 34 [f(x)]^2 $\n\nWe consider each interval $ [4k, 4k+4) $ for $ k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, 8 $, since $ x \\leq 34 $\n\nLet’s go through each $ k $ from 0 to 8.\n\n---\n\n### Case $ k = 0 $: $ x \\in [0, 4) $\n\nSubcases:\n\n1. $ x \\in [0, 1) $: $ f(x) = x $, so $ x = 34x^2 \\Rightarrow 34x^2 - x = 0 \\Rightarrow x(34x - 1) = 0 $\n\nSolutions: $ x = 0 $, $ x = \\frac{1}{34} $\n\nBoth in $ [0, 1) $, so valid.\n\nCorresponding $ y = f(x) = x $, so $ y = 0 $, $ y = \\frac{1}{34} $\n\n2. $ x \\in [1, 3) $: $ f(x) = 2 - x $, so $ x = 34(2 - x)^2 $\n\nLet $ y = 2 - x $, then $ x = 2 - y $, so $ 2 - y = 34y^2 \\Rightarrow 34y^2 + y - 2 = 0 $\n\nSolve: $ y = \\frac{ -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 272} }{68} = \\frac{ -1 \\pm \\sqrt{273} }{68} $\n\nNow $ x = 2 - y $, and $ x \\in [1, 3) $, so $ y = 2 - x \\in (-1, 1] $\n\nCheck both roots:\n\n- $ y = \\frac{ -1 + \\sqrt{273} }{68} $: $ \\sqrt{273} \\approx \\sqrt{256} = 16, \\sqrt{289} = 17 $, so $ \\sqrt{273} \\approx 16.52 $, so $ y \\approx \\frac{15.52}{68} \\approx 0.228 $, so $ x = 2 - y \\approx 1.772 \\in [1,3) $, valid.\n\n- $ y = \\frac{ -1 - \\sqrt{273} }{68} \\approx \\frac{-17.52}{68} \\approx -0.258 $, so $ x = 2 - y \\approx 2.258 \\in [1,3) $, also valid.\n\nSo both solutions valid.\n\nSo $ y = \\frac{ -1 \\pm \\sqrt{273} }{68} $\n\n3. $ x \\in [3, 4) $: $ f(x) = x - 4 $, so $ x = 34(x - 4)^2 $\n\nLet $ y = x - 4 $, so $ x = y + 4 $, $ y \\in [-1, 0) $\n\nThen $ y + 4 = 34y^2 \\Rightarrow 34y^2 - y - 4 = 0 $\n\nSolutions: $ y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 544}}{68} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{545}}{68} $\n\nNow $ y \\in [-1, 0) $, so check:\n\n- $ \\sqrt{545} \\approx \\sqrt{529} = 23, \\sqrt{576} = 24 $, so $ \\approx 23.34 $\n\nSo $ y = \\frac{1 + 23.34}{68} \\approx 24.34/68 \\approx 0.358 > 0 $, invalid\n\n$ y = \\frac{1 - 23.34}{68} \\approx -22.34/68 \\approx -0.328 \\in [-1, 0) $, valid.\n\nSo one solution: $ y = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{545}}{68} $\n\nSo for $ k = 0 $, we have:\n\n- From $ [0,1) $: $ y = 0 $, $ y = \\frac{1}{34} $\n- From $ [1,3) $: $ y = \\frac{ -1 \\pm \\sqrt{273} }{68} $\n- From $ [3,4) $: $ y = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{545}}{68} $\n\nTotal 5 solutions for $ k = 0 $\n\n---\n\n### Case $ k = 1 $: $ x \\in [4, 8) $\n\nSubcases:\n\n1. $ x \\in [4, 5) $: $ f(x) = x - 4 $, so $ x = 34(x - 4)^2 $\n\nLet $ y = x - 4 $, $ y \\in [0,1) $, so $ x = y + 4 $\n\nThen $ y + 4 = 34y^2 \\Rightarrow 34y^2 - y - 4 = 0 $\n\nSame as above: $ y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 544}}{68} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{545}}{68} $\n\nNow $ y \\in [0,1) $, so $ y = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{545}}{68} \\approx \\frac{24.34}{68} \\approx 0.358 \\in [0,1) $, valid\n\n$ y = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{545}}{68} \\approx -0.328 < 0 $, invalid\n\nSo one solution: $ y = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{545}}{68} $\n\n2. $ x \\in [5, 7) $: $ f(x) = 2 - (x - 4) = 6 - x $\n\nSo $ x = 34(6 - x)^2 $\n\nLet $ y = 6 - x $, so $ x = 6 - y $, $ y \\in (-1, 1] $ since $ x \\in [5,7) $\n\nThen $ 6 - y = 34y^2 \\Rightarrow 34y^2 + y - 6 = 0 $\n\nSolutions: $ y = \\frac{ -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 816} }{68} = \\frac{ -1 \\pm \\sqrt{817} }{68} $\n\nNow $ \\sqrt{817} \\approx \\sqrt{784} = 28, \\sqrt{841} = 29 $, so $ \\approx 28.58 $\n\nSo $ y = \\frac{ -1 + 28.58 }{68} \\approx 27.58/68 \\approx 0.405 \\in (-1,1] $, valid\n\n$ y = \\frac{ -1 - 28.58 }{68} \\approx -29.58/68 \\approx -0.435 \\in (-1,1] $, valid\n\nSo both valid.\n\nSo $ y = \\frac{ -1 \\pm \\sqrt{817} }{68} $\n\n3. $ x \\in [7, 8) $: $ f(x) = x - 8 $, so $ x = 34(x - 8)^2 $\n\nLet $ y = x - 8 $,"

        "We are given that $ a, b, c \\leq 3^6 = 729 $, and we want to count the number of ordered triples $ (a, b, c) $ of positive integers such that:\n\n$$\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^7 = 2187}\n$$\n\nWe are to compute $ N \\mod 1000 $, where $ N $ is the number of such ordered triples.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand cubes modulo $ 3^7 $\n\nWe are working modulo $ 3^7 = 2187 $. We want to understand the behavior of cubes modulo $ 3^k $, especially modulo $ 3^7 $.\n\nBut instead of working directly modulo $ 3^7 $, we can use **lifting** and **Hensel's lemma** ideas, or use **group structure** of cubes modulo powers of 3.\n\nBut a better idea is to use **modular arithmetic and counting** based on **residues modulo $ 3^7 $**.\n\nLet’s consider the **number of solutions** to $ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^7} $, where $ 1 \\leq a, b, c \\leq 3^6 $.\n\nNote: $ 3^6 = 729 $, so $ a, b, c \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 729\\} $. So each variable ranges over $ 3^6 $ values.\n\nLet’s define $ S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 3^6\\} $. So $ |S| = 3^6 $.\n\nWe want to count the number of $ (a,b,c) \\in S^3 $ such that $ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^7} $.\n\nLet’s define $ f(x) = x^3 \\mod 3^7 $. We want to understand the **distribution** of $ x^3 \\mod 3^7 $ for $ x \\in S $.\n\nBut $ S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 3^6\\} $, so $ x < 3^7 $, but $ x \\leq 3^6 $, so $ x $ ranges over the first $ 3^6 $ positive integers.\n\nLet’s consider the **number of distinct cubes modulo $ 3^7 $**.\n\nBut instead of that, we can use **group theory and lifting**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use known result about cubes modulo $ 3^k $\n\nThere is a known result about the number of solutions to $ x^3 \\equiv a \\pmod{3^k} $.\n\nBut more importantly, we can use **symmetry** and **uniform distribution** of cubes modulo $ 3^7 $.\n\nBut here’s a better idea: **use the fact that the cube function modulo $ 3^k $ is not uniformly distributed**, but we can use **lifting** and **counting via residues modulo $ 3^7 $**.\n\nBut here’s a key idea:\n\nLet’s consider the **number of solutions modulo $ 3^7 $** to $ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^7} $, where $ a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{3^7} $, and then restrict to $ a, b, c \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 3^6\\} $.\n\nBut $ 3^6 = 729 $, and $ 3^7 = 2187 $, so $ \\{1, 2, \\dots, 3^6\\} $ is **exactly half** of $ \\{1, 2, \\dots, 3^7 - 1\\} $, but not symmetric.\n\nBut here’s a better idea: **use the fact that the cube function modulo $ 3^k $ is periodic and has known image size**.\n\nLet’s recall that:\n\n- The multiplicative group modulo $ 3^k $ is cyclic for $ k \\geq 1 $, and $ (\\mathbb{Z}/3^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times $ is cyclic of order $ \\phi(3^k) = 2 \\cdot 3^{k-1} $.\n\n- The cube map $ x \\mapsto x^3 $ on $ (\\mathbb{Z}/3^k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times $ is a group homomorphism.\n\n- The kernel of this map has size $ \\gcd(3, \\phi(3^k)) = \\gcd(3, 2 \\cdot 3^{k-1}) = 3 $, so the image has size $ \\frac{2 \\cdot 3^{k-1}}{3} = 2 \\cdot 3^{k-2} $ for $ k \\geq 2 $.\n\nBut we are working with **all integers modulo $ 3^7 $**, including those divisible by 3.\n\nSo we need to consider the **number of cubes modulo $ 3^7 $**.\n\nLet’s define $ C_k = \\{ x^3 \\mod 3^k \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{Z}/3^k\\mathbb{Z} \\} $, the set of cubes modulo $ 3^k $.\n\nIt is known that the number of cubes modulo $ 3^k $ is $ 3^{k-1} $ for $ k \\geq 1 $.\n\nWait, let’s check small $ k $:\n\n- $ k = 1 $: modulo 3, cubes: $ 0^3 = 0 $, $ 1^3 = 1 $, $ 2^3 = 8 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 $. So cubes mod 3: $ \\{0,1,2\\} $, all residues. So 3 cubes.\n\n- $ k = 2 $: modulo 9. Compute $ x^3 \\mod 9 $ for $ x = 0 $ to $ 8 $:\n\n  - $ 0^3 = 0 $\n  - $ 1^3 = 1 $\n  - $ 2^3 = 8 $\n  - $ 3^3 = 27 \\equiv 0 $\n  - $ 4^3 = 64 \\equiv 1 $\n  - $ 5^3 = 125 \\equiv 8 $\n  - $ 6^3 = 216 \\equiv 0 $\n  - $ 7^3 = 343 \\equiv 1 $\n  - $ 8^3 = 512 \\equiv 8 $\n\n  So cubes mod 9: $ \\{0,1,8\\} $. So only 3 distinct cubes.\n\n- $ k = 3 $: modulo 27. How many cubes?\n\n  It is known that the number of cubes modulo $ 3^k $ is $ 3^{k-1} $ for $ k \\geq 1 $. So:\n\n  - $ k = 1 $: $ 3^0 = 1 $? But we have 3 cubes. So that’s not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of **distinct cubes modulo $ 3^k $** is $ 3^{k-1} $ for $ k \\geq 2 $? But for $ k = 2 $, we have 3 cubes, $ 3^{2-1} = 3 $, yes.\n\nFor $ k = 1 $: $ 3^0 = 1 $, but we have 3 cubes. So maybe the formula is different.\n\nActually, from number theory, the number of **cubic residues modulo $ 3^k $** is $ 3^{k-1} $ for $ k \\geq 2 $, and 3 for $ k = 1 $.\n\nBut let’s check $ k = 3 $: modulo 27.\n\nWe can compute the number of distinct cubes modulo 27.\n\nLet’s compute $ x^3 \\mod 27 $ for $ x = 0 $ to $ 26 $.\n\nBut we can use the fact that the cube map modulo $ 3^k $ has image size $ 3^{k-1} $ for $ k \\geq 2 $.\n\nSo for $ k = 7 $, number of distinct cubes modulo $ 3^7 $ is $ 3^{6} = 729 $.\n\nBut $ 3^7 = 2187 $, so there are $ 2187 $ residues modulo $ 3^7 $, and the cube map hits $ 3^6 = 729 $ distinct values.\n\nSo the cube function modulo $ 3^7 $ is **not injective**, but its image has size $ 3^6 $.\n\nNow, in our problem, $ a, b, c \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 3^6\\} $, so $ a, b, c \\leq 729 $, so $ a, b, c < 3^7 $, so they are in $ \\mathbb{Z}/3^7\\mathbb{Z} $.\n\nBut $ a $ ranges over $ 3^6 $ values.\n\nNow, the key idea is: **for each $ x \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 3^6\\} $, $ x^3 \\mod 3^7 $ is some value, and we want to count the number of triples $ (a,b,c) $ such that $ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^7} $**.\n\nLet’s define $ f(x) = x^3 \\mod 3^7 $. Then we want:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a=1}^{3^6} \\sum_{b=1}^{3^6} \\sum_{c=1}^{3^6} \\mathbf{1}_{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^7}}\n$$\n\nLet $ A = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 3^6\\} $. So $ |A| = 3^6 $.\n\nLet $ S = \\{ x^3 \\mod 3^7 \\mid x \\in A \\} $. But $ A $ has $ 3^6 $ elements, and the cube map modulo $ 3^7 $ has image size $ 3^6 $, so if the cube map is **injective** on $ A $, then $ S $ has $ 3^6 $ distinct values.\n\nBut is the cube map injective modulo $ 3^7 $ on $ \\{1, 2, \\dots, 3^6\\} $? Probably not.\n\nBut here’s a better idea: **use the fact that the cube function modulo $ 3^k $ is periodic and that the number of solutions to $ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^7} $ with $ a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{Z}/3^7\\mathbb{Z} $ is $ 3^{18} $, but we are only summing over $ a,b,c \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,3^6\\} $, which is a subset of size $ 3^6 $**.\n\nBut perhaps we can use **symmetry** and **uniform distribution**.\n\nLet’s consider the **distribution of $ x^3 \\mod 3^7 $** for $ x = 1 $ to $ 3^6 $.\n\nLet’s define $ T = \\{ x^3 \\mod 3^7 \\mid x = 1, 2, \\dots, 3^6 \\} $. Since $ 3^6 = 729 $, and the total number of cubes modulo $ 3^7 $ is $ 3^6 $, and $ T $ has $ 3^6 $ elements, if the cube map is **injective** on $ \\{1,2,\\dots,3^6\\} $, then $ T $ is exactly the set of all cubes modulo $ 3^7 $.\n\nBut is the cube map injective modulo $ 3^7 $ on $ \\{1,2,\\dots,3^6\\} $? Let’s see.\n\nSuppose $ x^3 \\equiv y^3 \\pmod{3^7} $ for $ x, y \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,3^6\\} $. Then $ 3^7 \\mid x^3 - y^3 = (x-y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) $.\n\nBut $ |x - y| < 3^6 $, so $ x - y $ is not divisible by $ 3^7 $, so $ x^3 \\equiv y^3 \\pmod{3^7} $ implies that $ x^2 + xy + y^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^7} $.\n\nBut $ x, y \\leq 3^6 $, so $ x^2 + xy + y^2 \\leq 3 \\cdot (3^6)^2 = 3 \\cdot 3^{12} = 3^{13} $, but we care about modulo $ 3^7 $.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the cube map modulo $ 3^k $ is **injective** on $ \\{1,2,\\dots,3^{k-1}\\} $.\n\nLet’s test for small $ k $.\n\nFor $ k = 2 $: $ 3^{k-1} = 3 $. So $ \\{1,2,3\\} $.\n\nCubes mod 9:\n\n- $ 1^3 = 1 $\n- $ 2^3 = 8 $\n- $ 3^3 = 27 \\equiv 0 $\n\nAll distinct.\n\nFor $ k = 3 $: $ 3^{2} = 9 $. So $ \\{1,2,\\dots,9\\} $.\n\nCompute cubes mod 27:\n\n- $ 1^3 = 1 $\n- $ 2^3 = 8 $\n- $ 3^3 = 27 \\equiv 0 $\n- $ 4^3 = 64 \\equiv 10 $\n- $ 5^3 = 125 \\equiv 125 - 4*27 = 125 - 108 = 17 $\n- $ 6^3 = 216 \\equiv 0 $\n- $ 7^3 = 343 \\equiv 343 - 12*27 = 343 - 324 = 19 $\n- $ 8^3 = 512 \\equiv 512 - 18*27 = 512 - 486 = 26 $\n- $ 9^3 = 729 \\equiv 0 $\n\nSo values: 1,8,0,10,17,0,19,26,0 — so 0 appears three times, so not injective.\n\nSo the cube map is not injective on $ \\{1,2,\\dots,3^{k-1}\\} $.\n\nSo that idea fails.\n\nBut here’s a better idea: **use the fact that the number of solutions to $ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^7} $ with $ a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{Z}/3^7\\mathbb{Z} $ is $ 3^{18} $, but we are only summing over $ a,b,c \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,3^6\\} $, which is a subset of size $ 3^6 $**.\n\nBut perhaps we can use **generating functions**.\n\nLet $ f(x) = \\sum_{a=1}^{3^6} x^{a^3 \\mod 3^7} $. Then the number of solutions is the coefficient of $ x^0 $ in $ f(x)^3 $, modulo $ x^{3^7} - 1 $.\n\nBut this is hard to compute.\n\nBut here’s a key insight: **the cube function modulo $ 3^7 $ is periodic with period $ 3^7 $, and the values $ a^3 \\mod 3^7 $ for $ a = 1 $ to $ 3^6 $ are uniformly distributed over the cube residues modulo $ 3^7 $**.\n\nBut we know that the number of cube residues modulo $ 3^7 $ is $ 3^6 $, and we have $ 3^6 $ values of $ a $, so if the cube map is **bijective** from $ \\{1,2,\\dots,3^6\\} $ to the set of cube residues modulo $ 3^7 $, then each cube residue appears exactly once.\n\nBut from earlier, for $ k = 3 $, $ \\{1,2,\\dots,9\\} $ maps to 9 values, but only 7 distinct cubes (0,1,8,10,17,19,26), so not injective.\n\nSo that fails.\n\nBut perhaps we can use **lifting** and **Hensel's lemma**.\n\nLet’s consider the equation $ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3^7} $.\n\nWe can use **counting via lifting** from lower powers.\n\nLet’s define $ N_k $ as the number of solutions modulo $ 3^k $, but we are not working modulo $ 3^k $, we are working with $ a,b,c \\leq 3^6 $, so $ a,b,c < 3^7 $, so we are working in $ \\mathbb{Z}/3^7\\mathbb{Z} $.\n\nBut the key is that $ a,b,c \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,3^6\\} $, so they are in the first $ 3^6 $ positive integers.\n\nLet’s consider the **distribution of $ a^3 \\mod 3^7 $** for $ a = 1 $ to $ 3^6 $.\n\nLet’s define $ C = \\{ a^3 \\mod 3^7 \\mid a = 1,2,\\dots,3^6 \\} $.

Let’s place point $ A $ at the origin: $ A = 0 $.

        "Let’s solve the problem step by step.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- Circle $\\omega_1$ has radius 6 and is centered at $A$.\n- $\\omega_1$ is internally tangent to $\\omega_2$ at point $B$, and $\\omega_2$ has radius 15.\n- So, the center of $\\omega_2$ is at a point $O$, and since the circles are tangent internally at $B$, the centers $O$, $A$, and $B$ are collinear, with $OA = OB - AB = 15 - 6 = 9$.\n- Let’s place the figure on the coordinate plane.\n\nLet’s place $O$ at the origin $(0,0)$, so $\\omega_2$ is centered at $(0,0)$ with radius 15.\n\nSince $A$ lies on $OB$ and $OA = 9$, and $B$ is the point of tangency, $B$ lies on the line $OA$, and since $AB = 6$, $B$ is at distance 15 from $O$, so $B = (15, 0)$, and $A = (9, 0)$.\n\nNow, $BC$ is a diameter of $\\omega_2$, so $C = (-15, 0)$.\n\nWe are told that $\\overline{BC} \\perp \\overline{AD}$.\n\nSince $BC$ is along the x-axis, $\\overline{AD}$ must be vertical (perpendicular to x-axis), so $AD$ is vertical.\n\nBut $A = (9, 0)$, so $D$ lies on the vertical line $x = 9$, and $D$ lies on $\\omega_2$, so $D$ satisfies $x^2 + y^2 = 225$, $x = 9$:\n\n$$\n9^2 + y^2 = 225 \\Rightarrow 81 + y^2 = 225 \\Rightarrow y^2 = 144 \\Rightarrow y = \\pm 12\n$$\n\nSo $D = (9, 12)$ or $(9, -12)$. From the diagram, $D$ is above the x-axis, so $D = (9, 12)$.\n\nNow, rectangle $EFGH$ is inscribed in $\\omega_1$, which is centered at $A = (9, 0)$ with radius 6.\n\nLet’s suppose the rectangle has sides parallel to the coordinate axes? But wait: we are told $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, and $BC$ is horizontal, so $EF$ is vertical.\n\nSo $EF$ is vertical, so the rectangle has vertical and horizontal sides.\n\nWait: $\\overline{EF} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, and $BC$ is horizontal, so $EF$ is vertical.\n\nSo the rectangle has vertical and horizontal sides.\n\nLet’s suppose $EFGH$ is axis-aligned rectangle inscribed in $\\omega_1$.\n\nBut wait: the Asymptote code shows that the rectangle is rotated.\n\nWait: in the Asymptote code:\n\n```asy\nE = (9+12/sqrt(5), -6/sqrt(5)), F = (9+12/sqrt(5), 6/sqrt(5)), G = (9-12/sqrt(5), 6/sqrt(5)), H = (9-12/sqrt(5), -6/sqrt(5))\n```\n\nSo $EF$ is vertical? Let's check:\n\n$E$ and $F$ have same x-coordinate: $9 + 12/\\sqrt{5}$, different y: $-6/\\sqrt{5}$ and $6/\\sqrt{5}$, so yes, $EF$ is vertical.\n\nSimilarly, $GH$ is vertical, $FG$ and $EH$ are horizontal.\n\nSo the rectangle has vertical and horizontal sides.\n\nSo it is axis-aligned.\n\nBut wait: the center of $\\omega_1$ is at $(9,0)$, and the rectangle is inscribed in it.\n\nSo the rectangle is axis-aligned, centered at $(9,0)$, with vertical and horizontal sides.\n\nLet the rectangle have width $2a$, height $2b$, so vertices:\n\n- $E = (9 + a, -b)$\n- $F = (9 + a, b)$\n- $G = (9 - a, b)$\n- $H = (9 - a, -b)$\n\nSince it's inscribed in circle of radius 6 centered at $(9,0)$, the distance from center to any vertex is 6.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\na^2 + b^2 = 36\n$$\n\nNow, we are told:\n\n- $C = (-15, 0)$\n- $D = (9, 12)$\n- $C$ is closer to $\\overline{GH}$ than to $\\overline{EF}$\n- $D$ is closer to $\\overline{FG}$ than to $\\overline{EH}$\n\nLet’s analyze.\n\nFirst, $\\overline{GH}$: from $G = (9 - a, b)$ to $H = (9 - a, -b)$, so it's the left side of the rectangle, vertical line $x = 9 - a$\n\n$\\overline{EF}$: right side, $x = 9 + a$\n\nSo distance from $C = (-15, 0)$ to $\\overline{GH}$ is $| -15 - (9 - a) | = | -24 + a |$\n\nDistance to $\\overline{EF}$ is $| -15 - (9 + a) | = | -24 - a | = 24 + a$\n\nWe are told $C$ is closer to $\\overline{GH}$ than to $\\overline{EF}$, so:\n\n$$\n| -24 + a | < 24 + a\n$$\n\nSince $a > 0$, $24 + a > 0$, so we can analyze:\n\nCase 1: $a < 24$: then $| -24 + a | = 24 - a$\n\nSo $24 - a < 24 + a \\Rightarrow -a < a \\Rightarrow 0 < 2a$, always true.\n\nSo for $a < 24$, this inequality holds.\n\nBut since $a^2 + b^2 = 36$, $a < 6$, so $a < 24$ is always true.\n\nSo this condition is automatically satisfied.\n\nNow, $D = (9, 12)$\n\n$\\overline{FG}$: from $F = (9 + a, b)$ to $G = (9 -

(-b)| = |12 + b| = 12 + b$ (since $b > 0$)\n\nWe are told $D$ is closer to $\\overline{FG}$ than to $\\overline{EH}$, so:\n\n$$\n|12 - b| < 12 + b\n$$\n\nAgain, since $b > 0$, $12 + b > 0$, and $|12 - b| < 12 + b$ is always true if $b > 0$, because:\n\n- If $b \\leq 12$: $|12 - b| = 12 - b < 12 + b$\n- If $b > 12$: $|12 - b| = b - 12 < 12 + b$, which is $-12 < 12$, true.\n\nSo both conditions are automatically satisfied for any $a, b > 0$ with $a^2 + b^2 = 36$.\n\nSo we need to use the area condition.\n\nWe are told that triangles $\\triangle DGF$ and $\\triangle CHG$ have equal areas.\n\nLet’s compute their areas.\n\nFirst, points:\n\n- $D = (9, 12)$\n- $G = (9 - a, b)$\n- $F = (9 + a, b)$\n\nSo triangle $DGF$: points $D, G, F$\n\nSimilarly, $C = (-15, 0)$, $H = (9 - a, -b)$, $G = (9 - a, b)$\n\nSo triangle $CHG$: points $C, H, G$\n\nLet’s compute area of $\\triangle DGF$\n\nUse shoelace formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|\n$$\n\nLet’s label:\n\n- $D = (9, 12)$\n- $G = (9 - a, b)$\n- $F = (9 + a, b)$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |9(b - b) + (9 - a)(b - 12) + (9 + a)(12 - b)|\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: $9(0) = 0$\n\nSecond: $(9 - a)(b - 12)$\n\nThird: $(9 + a)(12 - b)$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} | (9 - a)(b - 12) + (9 + a)(12 - b) |\n$$\n\nNote that $(12 - b) = - (b - 12)$, so:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} | (9 - a)(b - 12) - (9 + a)(b - 12) | = \\frac{1}{2} | [(9 - a) - (9 + a)] (b - 12) |\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} | (9 - a - 9 - a)(b - 12) | = \\frac{1}{2} | (-2a)(b - 12) | = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2a |b - 12| = a |b - 12|\n$$\n\nNow, since $b^2 \\leq 36$, $b \\leq 6 < 12$, so $|b - 12| = 12 - b$\n\nSo area of $\\triangle DGF = a(12 - b)$\n\nNow compute area of $\\triangle CHG$\n\nPoints:\n\n- $C = (-15, 0)$\n- $H = (9 - a, -b)$\n- $G = (9 - a, b)$\n\nNote: $H$ and $G$ have same x-coordinate, so $HG$ is vertical.\n\nUse shoelace:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_C(y_H - y_G) + x_H(y_G - y_C) + x_G(y_C - y_H)|\n$$\n\nPlug in:\n\n- $x_C = -15$, $y_C = 0$\n- $x_H = 9 - a$, $y_H = -b$\n- $x_G = 9 - a$, $y_G = b$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} | (-15)(-b - b) + (9 - a)(b - 0) + (9 - a)(0 - (-b)) |\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} | (-15)(-2b) + (9 - a)(b) + (9 - a)(b) |\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} | 30b + b(9 - a) + b(9 - a) | = \\frac{1}{2} |30b + 2b(9 - a)| = \\frac{1}{2} |30b + 18b - 2ab| = \\frac{1}{2} |48b - 2ab|\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2b |24 - a| = b |24 - a|\n$$\n\nSince $a < 6 < 24$, $|24 - a| = 24 - a$\n\nSo area of $\\triangle CHG = b(24 - a)$\n\nSet the two areas equal:\n\n$$\na(12 - b) = b(24 - a)\n$$\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft: $12a - ab$\n\nRight: $24b - ab$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n12a - ab = 24b - ab\n$$\n\nAdd $ab$ to both sides:\n\n$$\n12a = 24b \\Rightarrow a = 2b\n$$\n\nNow recall from the circle: $a^2 + b^2 = 36$\n\nSubstitute $a = 2b$:\n\n$$\n(2b)^2 + b^2 = 36 \\Rightarrow 4b^2 + b^2 = 36 \\Rightarrow 5b^2 = 36 \\Rightarrow b^2 = \\frac{36}{5} \\Rightarrow b = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{5}}\n$$\n\nThen $a = 2b = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{5}}$\n\nNow, the rectangle has width $2a = \\frac{24}{\\sqrt{5}}$, height $2b = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{5}}$\n\nArea = $2a \\cdot 2b = 4ab$\n\nWe have $a = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{5}}$, $b = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{5}}$, so:\n\n$$\nab = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{72}{5}\n$$\n\nSo area = $4 \\cdot \\frac{72}{5} = \\frac{288}{5}$\n\nSo area of rectangle is $\\frac{288}{5}$\n\nThus $m = 288$, $n = 5$, relatively prime.\n\nSo $m + n = 288 + 5 = 293$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{293}"

We are interested in the number of **nonempty** subsets $ B \\subseteq A $ such that:\n\n$$\n\\text{lcm}(B) = 2025\n$$\n\nWe want the probability of such subsets, so we need to count how many such subsets exist.\n\nLet’s define the set $ A $ as all divisors of $ 2025 $. Each divisor $ d $ of $ 2025 $ can be written as $ 3^a 5^b $, where $ 0 \\leq a \\leq 4 $, $ 0 \\leq b \\leq 2 $.\n\nWe want subsets $ B \\subseteq A $, nonempty, such that $ \\text{lcm}(B) = 2025 $.

But is it true that any subset $ B $ that contains at least one element from $ T_3 $ and at least one from $ T_5 $ has $ \\text{lcm}(B) = 2025 $?\n\nNo! Because $ \\text{lcm}(B) $ is determined by the maximum exponents of $ 3 $ and $ 5 $ in the elements of $ B $. So:\n\n- $ \\text{lcm}(B) $ has $ 3^a $ where $ a = \\max \\{ \\text{exponent of } 3 \\text{ in } b \\mid b \\in B \\} $\n- Similarly for $ 5 $\n\nSo $ \\text{lcm}(B) = 2025 $ iff:\n\n- $ \\max \\{ \\text{exponent of } 3 \\text{ in } b \\mid b \\in B \\} = 4 $\n- $ \\max \\{ \\text{exponent of } 5 \\text{ in } b \\mid b \\in B \\} = 2 $\n\nSo we need:\n\n- $ B $ contains at least one divisor with $ 3 $-exponent $ 4 $\n- $ B $ contains at least one divisor with $ 5 $-exponent $ 2 $\n\nBut it's possible that $ B $ contains such elements, but also contains other elements — but the lcm is still determined by the max exponents.\n\nSo yes: $ \\text{lcm}(B) = 2025 $ iff $ B $ contains at least one element with $ 3 $-exponent $ 4 $ and at least one with $ 5 $-exponent $ 2 $\n\nSo the number of such subsets is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Number of subsets } B \\subseteq A \\text{ such that } B \\cap T_3 \\neq \\emptyset \\text{ and } B \\cap T_5 \\neq \\emptyset\n$$\n\nThis is:\n\n$$\n2^{15} - 2^{12} - 2^{10} + 2^8\n$$\n\nBecause:\n\n- Total subsets: $ 2^{15} $\n- Subtract subsets with no $ T_3 $: $ 2^{12} $\n- Subtract subsets with no $ T_5 $: $ 2^{10} $\n- Add back subsets with no $ T_3 $ and no $ T_5 $: $ 2^8 $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nN = 2^{15} - 2^{12} - 2^{10} + 2^8\n$$\n\nNow, this includes the empty set? Let's check: the empty set has no elements, so $ B \\cap T_3 = \\emptyset $, $ B \\cap T_5 = \\emptyset $, so it is subtracted in the inclusion-exclusion. So the count $ N $ is the number of subsets that have at least one from $ T_3 $ and at least one from $ T_5 $. So it's nonempty.\n\nSo $ N $ is the number of subsets $ B $ such that $ \\text{lcm}(B) = 2025 $\n\nSo the probability is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{N}{2^{15}} = \\frac{2^{15} - 2^{12} - 2^{10} + 2^8}{2^{15}} = 1 - 2^{-3} - 2^{-5} + 2^{-7}\n$$\n\nBut we can write it as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2^{15} - 2^{12} - 2^{10} + 2^8}{2^{15}} = \\frac{2^8 (2^7 - 2^4 - 2^2 + 1)}{2^{15}} = \\frac{2^7 - 2^4 - 2^2 + 1}{2^7}\n$$\n\nWait, better to compute numerator and denominator.\n\nLet’s compute:\n\n- $ 2^{15} = 32768 $\n- $ 2^{12} = 4096 $\n- $ 2^{10} = 1024 $\n- $ 2^8 = 256 $\n\nSo numerator:\n\n$$\n32768 - 4096 - 1024 + 256 = 32768 - 4096 = 28672; 28672 - 1024 = 27648; 27648 + 256 = 27904\n$$\n\nSo numerator = 27904\n\nDenominator = 32768\n\nSo probability = $ \\frac{27904}{32768} $\n\nNow reduce this fraction.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n- $ 27904 \\div 16 = 1744 $\n- $ 32768 \\div 16 = 2048 $\n\nWait, better to divide by 8:\n\n- $ 27904 \\div 8 = 3488 $\n- $ 32768 \\div 8 = 4096 $\n\nAgain:\n\n- $ 3488 \\div 8 = 436 $\n- $ 4096 \\div 8 = 512 $\n\nAgain:\n\n- $ 436 \\div 4 = 109 $\n- $ 512 \\div 4 = 128 $\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\frac{27904}{32768} = \\frac{109}{128}\n$$\n\nWait, check:\n\n- $ 109 \\times 256 = ? $\n\nWait, let's do GCD of 27904 and 32768.\n\nLet’s compute GCD(27904, 32768)\n\nUse Euclidean algorithm:\n\n- $ 32768 - 27904 = 4864 $\n- GCD(27904, 4864)\n\n$ 27904 \\div 4864 = 5 \\times 4864 = 24320 $, remainder $ 27904 - 24320 = 3584 $\n\nGCD(4864, 3584)\n\n$ 4864 - 3584 = 1280 $\n\nGCD(3584, 1280)\n\n$ 3584 \\div 1280 = 2 \\times 1280 = 2560 $, remainder $ 3584 - 2560 = 1024 $\n\nGCD(1280, 1024)\n\n$ 1280 - 1024 = 256 $\n\nGCD(1024, 256) = 256\n\nSo GCD is 256\n\nSo:\n\n- $ 27904 \\div 256 = ? $\n\n$ 256 \\times 100 = 25600 $, $ 27904 - 25600 = 2304 $\n\n$ 256 \\times 9 = 2304 $, so $ 100 + 9 = 109 $\n\nSo $ 27904 = 256 \\times 109 $\n\n$ 32768 \\div 256 = 128 $\n\nSo $ \\frac{27904}{32768} = \\frac{109}{128} $\n\nSo probability is $ \\frac{109}{128} $\n\nBut wait: is this correct?\n\nWait: we said that any subset $ B $ that contains at least one element from $ T_3 $ and at least one from $ T_5 $ has $ \\text{lcm}(B) = 2025 $. Is that true?\n\nYes, because:\n\n- The maximum exponent of $ 3 $ in $ B $ is at least $ 4 $, and since all divisors of $ 2025 $ have $ 3 $-exponent $ \\leq 4 $, the max is exactly $ 4 $\n- Similarly, max exponent of $ 5 $ is exactly $ 2 $\n- So $ \\text{lcm}(B) = 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 = 2025 $\n\nSo yes, the condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\nSo number of such subsets is $ 2^{15} - 2^{12} - 2^{10} + 2^8 = 27904 $\n\nTotal subsets: $ 2^{15} = 32768 $\n\nSo probability: $ \\frac{27904}{32768} = \\frac{109}{128} $\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"nonempty set with the property that the lcm of its elements is 2025\"\n\nBut our count includes only subsets that have at least one from $ T_3 $ and at least one from $ T_5 $. But is it possible that a subset has lcm $ 2025 $ but does not contain an element with $ 3^4 $? No, because then max exponent of $ 3 $ would be $ \\leq 3 $, so lcm would have $ 3^3 $, not $ 3^4 $. Similarly for $ 5 $. So yes, the condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\nSo the number of such subsets is $ 27904 $, and total subsets is $ 32768 $, so probability is $ \\frac{109}{128} $\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"nonempty set\", but our count already excludes the empty set, since empty set has no elements from $ T_3 $ or $ T_5 $. So we are good.\n\nSo $ m = 109 $, $ n = 128 $, $ m+n = 237 $\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{237}"

He uses the so-called greedy algorithm, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N.$ For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins. In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\n\nSolution:",

He uses the so-called greedy algorithm, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N.$ For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins. In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\n\nSolution:"

        "We are given 16 chairs in a row, and we want to choose 8 chairs such that **no person sits next to two other people**. This means that **no selected chair is adjacent to two other selected chairs**.\n\nLet’s interpret the condition carefully.\n\nWe are selecting 8 chairs (i.e., placing 8 people) such that **no person has two neighbors**. That is, **no selected chair is adjacent to two other selected chairs**.\n\nBut since the chairs are in a row, a chair can have at most two neighbors: one on the left and one on the right.\n\nSo, the condition \"no person sits next to two other people\" means that **no selected chair has both its left and right neighbors also selected**.\n\nIn other words, **no three consecutive chairs are all selected**.\n\nBecause if three consecutive chairs are selected, say chairs $i$, $i+1$, $i+2$, then the person in chair $i+1$ is adjacent to two other people (chairs $i$ and $i+2$), which violates the condition.\n\nSo the condition is equivalent to: **no three consecutive chairs are selected**.\n\nBut is that sufficient?\n\nLet’s check: suppose we have a chair that is adjacent to two selected chairs, but not both neighbors are selected? Wait, the condition is that **no person sits next to two other people**, meaning that **no selected chair has both neighbors selected**.\n\nSo the condition is: **no selected chair has both its left and right neighbors selected**.\n\nThis is **not** the same as \"no three consecutive chairs selected\".\n\nWait: suppose we have chairs $i-1$, $i$, $i+1$ selected. Then chair $i$ has both neighbors selected → violates the condition.\n\nBut suppose we have chairs $i-1$, $i$, $i+2$ selected, but $i+1$ not selected. Then chair $i$ has only one neighbor (chair $i-1$) selected, so it's okay.\n\nBut if we have chairs $i-1$, $i$, $i+1$, $i+2$ selected, then chair $i+1$ has both neighbors selected → violates the condition.\n\nSo the condition is that **no selected chair has both neighbors selected**.\n\nThis is equivalent to: **no three consecutive chairs are selected**.\n\nWait: suppose we have chairs $i-1$, $i$, $i+1$ selected → chair $i$ has both neighbors selected → violates.\n\nBut if we have chairs $i-1$, $i$, $i+2$ selected → chair $i$ has only one neighbor selected → okay.\n\nSo the forbidden configuration is **three consecutive selected chairs**.\n\nBut is that the only way a selected chair can have both neighbors selected?\n\nYes. Because if a chair $i$ has both neighbors selected, then chairs $i-1$, $i$, $i+1$ are all selected → three consecutive chairs.\n\nSo the condition is equivalent to: **no three consecutive chairs are selected**.\n\nSo we are to count the number of 8-element subsets of 16 chairs arranged in a row such that **no three consecutive chairs are selected**.\n\nLet’s define $a_n(k)$ as the number of ways

        "Let’s denote $ x = A_1A_2 $, $ y = A_1A_{11} $, and $ z_i = A_iA_{i+1} $ for $ 2 \\le i \\le 10 $. The total perimeter is:\n\n$$\nx + y + \\sum_{i=2}^{10} z_i = 20\n$$\n\nWe are told that for each $ 2 \\le i \\le 10 $, the area of triangle $ A_iA_1A_{i+1} $ is 1, and $ \\cos(\\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1}) = \\frac{12}{13} $. Let’s use the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot A_1A_i \\cdot A_1A_{i+1} \\cdot \\sin(\\theta_i)\n$$\n\nBut we don’t know $ A_1A_i $ or $ A_1A_{i+1} $ directly. However, we do know that $ \\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1} $ has cosine $ \\frac{12}{13} $, so $ \\sin(\\theta_i) = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{12}{13}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{144}{169}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{169}} = \\frac{5}{13} $.\n\nLet’s denote $ a_i = A_1A_i $. Then the area of triangle $ A_iA_1A_{i+1} $ is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} a_i a_{i+1} \\cdot \\frac{5}{13} = 1 \\Rightarrow a_i a_{i+1} = \\frac{26}{5}\n$$\n\nSo for $ 2 \\le i \\le 10 $, $ a_i a_{i+1} = \\frac{26}{5} $. This gives a recurrence relation.\n\nLet’s define $ a_2 = x $, $ a_3 = \\frac{26}{5x} $, $ a_4 = \\frac{26}{5a_3} = \\frac{26}{5 \\cdot \\frac{26}{5x}} = x $, $ a_5 = \\frac{26}{5a_4} = \\frac{26}{5x} $, and so on.\n\nSo the sequence $ a_i $ for $ i = 2 $ to $ 11 $ is periodic with period 2:\n\n$$\na_2 = x, \\quad a_3 = \\frac{26}{5x}, \\quad a_4 = x, \\quad a_5 = \\frac{26}{5x}, \\quad \\dots\n$$\n\nSince $ i $ goes from 2 to 11, that’s 10 terms: $ a_2, a_3, \\dots, a_{11} $. So:\n\n- Odd indices: $ a_2, a_4, a_6, a_8, a_{10} $: all equal to $ x $\n- Even indices: $ a_3, a_5, a_7, a_9, a_{11} $: all equal to $ \\frac{26}{5x} $\n\nSo $ a_{11} = \\frac{26}{5x} $\n\nBut $ a_{11} = A_1A_{11} = y $, so:\n\n$$\ny = \\frac{26}{5x}\n$$\n\nNow, we can express $ x + y = x + \\frac{26}{5x} $\n\nNow, we need to find the lengths $ z_i = A_iA_{i+1} $ for $ i = 2 $ to $ 10 $. Use the Law of Cosines in triangle $ A_iA_1A_{i+1} $:\n\n$$\nz_i^2 = a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - 2a_i a_{i+1} \\cos(\\theta_i)\n$$\n\nWe know $ a_i a_{i+1} = \\frac{26}{5} $, $ \\cos(\\theta_i) = \\frac{12}{13} $, so:\n\n$$\nz_i^2 = a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{26}{5} \\cdot \\frac{12}{13} = a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - \\frac{52}{5} \\cdot \\frac{12}{13} = a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - \\frac{624}{65} = a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - \\frac{48}{5}\n$$\n\nNow, for $ i $ odd: $ a_i = x $, $ a_{i+1} = \\frac{26}{5x} $\n\nSo $ z_i^2 = x^2 + \\left(\\frac{26}{5x}\\right)^2 - \\frac{48}{5} = x^2 + \\frac{676}{25x^2} - \\frac{48}{5} $\n\nSimilarly, for $ i $ even: $ a_i = \\frac{26}{5x} $, $ a_{i+1} = x $, so same expression.\n\nSo all $ z_i $ for $ i = 2 $ to $ 10 $ have the same length $ z $, since the expression is symmetric.\n\nSo $ z_i = z $ for all $ i = 2 $ to $ 10 $, and there are 9 such segments.\n\nSo total perimeter:\n\n$$\nx + y + 9z = 20\n$$\n\nBut $ y = \\frac{26}{5x} $, so:\n\n$$\nx + \\frac{26}{5x} + 9z = 20\n$$\n\nWe also have:\n\n$$\nz^2 = x^2 + \\frac{676}{25x^2} - \\frac{48}{5}\n$$\n\nLet’s set $ u = x^2 $. Then $ z^2 = u + \\frac{676}{25u} - \\frac{48}{5} $\n\nLet’s denote $ s = x + \\frac{26}{5x} $. Then $ s = x + y $, which is what we want.\n\nLet’s compute $ s^2 = x^2 + 2 \\cdot x \\cdot \\frac{26}{5x} + \\left(\\frac{26}{5x}\\right)^2 = u + \\frac{52}{5} + \\frac{676}{25u} $\n\nSo $ s^2 = u + \\frac{676}{25u} + \\frac{52}{5} $\n\nBut from $ z^2 = u + \\frac{676}{25u} - \\frac{48}{5} $, so $ u + \\frac{676}{25u} = z^2 + \\frac{48}{5} $\n\nThus:\n\n$$\ns^2 = z^2 + \\frac{48}{5} + \\frac{52}{5} = z^2 + 20\n$$\n\nSo $ s^2 = z^2 + 20 $\n\nNow, from perimeter:\n\n$$\ns + 9z = 20 \\Rightarrow s = 20 - 9z\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n(20 - 9z)^2 = z^2 + 20\n$$\n\nExpand:\n\n$$\n400 - 360z + 81z^2 = z^2 + 20\n\\Rightarrow 80z^2 - 360z + 380 = 0\n\\Rightarrow 8z^2 - 36z + 38 = 0\n\\Rightarrow 4z^2 - 18z + 19 = 0\n$$\n\nSolve:\n\n$$\nz = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{(-18)^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 19}}{2 \\cdot 4} = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{324 - 304}}{8} = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{8} = \\frac{18 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{8} = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{4}\n$$\n\nNow, $ s = 20 - 9z $\n\nTry $ z = \\frac{9 + \\sqrt{5}}{4} $: then $ 9z = \\frac{81 + 9\\sqrt{5}}{4} $, $ s = 20 - \\frac{81 + 9\\sqrt{5}}{4} = \\frac{80 - 81 - 9\\sqrt{5}}{4} = \\frac{-1 - 9\\sqrt{5}}{4} < 0 $, invalid.\n\nTry $ z = \\frac{9 - \\sqrt{5}}{4} $: $ 9z = \\frac{81 - 9\\sqrt{5}}{4} $, $ s = 20 - \\frac{81 - 9\\sqrt{5}}{4} = \\frac{80 - 81 + 9\\sqrt{5}}{4} = \\frac{-1 + 9\\sqrt{5}}{4} $\n\nSo $ s = x + y = \\frac{9\\sqrt{5} - 1}{4} $\n\nThis is in the form $ \\frac{m\\sqrt{n} - p}{q} $, with $ m = 9 $, $ n = 5 $, $ p = 1 $, $ q = 4 $\n\nCheck $ \\gcd(m,p,q) = \\gcd(9,1,4) = 1 $, $ n = 5 $ squarefree.\n\nSo $ m + n + p + q = 9 + 5 + 1 + 4 = 19 $\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\boxed{019}"

Then:\n\n- $ AK^2 = x_1^2 + y_1^2 = 196 $\n- $ BK^2 = (x_1 - b)^2 + y_1^2 = 196 $\n\nSubtracting:\n\n$$\n(x_1 - b)^2 + y_1^2 - (x_1^2 + y_1^2) = 0 \\Rightarrow x_1^2 - 2bx_1 + b^2 + y_1^2 - x_1^2 - y_1^2 = 0\n\\Rightarrow -2bx_1 + b^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x_1 = \\frac{b}{2}\n$$\n\nThen from $ x_1^2 + y_1^2 = 196 $:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 + y_1^2 = 196 \\Rightarrow \\frac{b^2}{4} + y_1^2 = 196 \\Rightarrow y_1^2 = 196 - \\frac{b^2}{4}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for $ L = (x_2, y_2) $, with $ AL = 14 $, $ CL = 14 $:\n\n- $ x_2^2 + y_2^2 = 196 $\n- $ x_2^2 + (y_2 - c)^2 = 196 $\n\nSubtract:\n\n$$\nx_2^2 + y_2^2 - 2cy_2 + c^2 - x_2^2 - y_2^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow -2cy_2 + c^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y_2 = \\frac{c}{2}\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nx_2^2 + \\left(\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2 = 196 \\Rightarrow x_2^2 = 196 - \\frac{c^2}{4}\n$$\n\nNow, $ KL = 14 $, so:\n\n$$\n(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 = 196\n$$\n\nSubstitute:\n\n- $ x_1 = \\frac{b}{2} $\n- $ y_1^2 = 196 - \\frac{b^2}{4} $\n- $ y_2 = \\frac{c}{2} $\n- $ x_2^2 = 196 - \\frac{c^2}{4} $\n\nLet’s write $ x_2 = \\pm \\sqrt{196 - \\frac{c^2}{4}} $, $ y_1 = \\pm \\sqrt{196 - \\frac{b^2}{4}} $\n\nBut since $ K $ and $ L $ are inside triangle $ ABC $, and $ A = (0,0), B = (b,0), C = (0,c) $, we expect $ K $ to be in the first quadrant, so $ x_1 = b/2 > 0 $, $ y_1 > 0 $, similarly $ x_2 > 0 $, $ y_2 = c/2 > 0 $. So we take positive roots.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nx_1 = \\frac{b}{2}, \\quad y_1 = \\sqrt{196 - \\frac{b^2}{4}}, \\quad x_2 = \\sqrt{196 - \\frac{c^2}{4}}, \\quad y_2 = \\frac{c}{2}\n$$\n\nNow compute $ KL^2 $:\n\n$$\nKL^2 = \\left(\\frac{b}{2} - \\sqrt{196 - \\frac{c^2}{4}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\sqrt{196 - \\frac{b^2}{4}} - \\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2 = 196\n$$\n\nThis looks messy. But notice that $ AK = AL = BK = CL = KL = 14 $, so quadrilateral $ AKL $ and $ BKL $ have many equal sides.\n\nLet’s consider triangle $ AKL $: $ AK = AL = KL = 14 $, so $ \\triangle AKL $ is equilateral.\n\nSimilarly, $ BK = KL = 14 $, but $ BL $ is not necessarily 14.\n\nWait: $ AK = AL = KL = 14 $, so triangle $ AKL $ is equilateral.\n\nSimilarly, $ BK = KL = 14 $, but $ BL $ is not given.\n\nBut $ AK = AL = KL = 14 $, so $ \\angle KAL = 60^\\circ $\n\nSimilarly, $ BK = KL = 14 $, but $ BL $ is not known.\n\nBut $ AK = AL = 14 $, $ \\angle KAL = 60^\\circ $, so $ \\angle KAL = 60^\\circ $\n\nBut $ \\angle A = 90^\\circ $, so $ \\angle KAB + \\angle LAC = 30^\\circ $\n\nLet’s use vectors or geometry.\n\nLet’s suppose $ \\angle KAL = 60^\\circ $, and $ AK = AL = 14 $, so $ \\triangle AKL $ is equilateral.\n\nLet’s place $ A $ at origin.\n\nLet $ \\vec{AK} $ and $ \\vec{AL} $ be vectors of length 14 with angle $ 60^\\circ $ between them.\n\nLet $ \\vec{AK} = 14(\\cos \\theta, \\sin \\theta) $, $ \\vec{AL} = 14(\\cos(\\theta + 60^\\circ), \\sin(\\theta + 60^\\circ)) $\n\nBut $ B $ is such that $ BK = 14 $, and $ B $ lies on the x-axis (since $ \\angle A = 90^\\circ $), so $ B = (b, 0) $\n\nSimilarly, $ C = (0, c) $\n\nSo $ K $ lies on circle center $ A $ radius 14 and center $ B $ radius 14.\n\nSo $ K $ is at intersection of two circles:\n\n- $ x^2 + y^2 = 196 $\n- $ (x - b)^2 + y^2 = 196 $\n\nAs before, subtract: $ x = b/2 $, $ y = \\sqrt{196 - b^2/4} $\n\nSimilarly, $ L $ lies on:\n\n- $ x^2 + y^2 = 196 $\n- $ x^2 + (y - c)^2 = 196 $\n\nSo $ y = c/2 $, $ x = \\sqrt{196 - c^2/4} $\n\nNow $ KL = 14 $, so:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{b}{2} - \\sqrt{196 - \\frac{c^2}{4}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\sqrt{196 - \\frac{b^2}{4}} - \\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2 = 196\n$$\n\nLet’s denote $ u = b^2 $, $ v = c^2 $, $ u + v = 1444 $\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet $ x = \\frac{b}{2} $, $ y = \\frac{c}{2} $, so $ b = 2x $, $ c = 2y $, then $ b^2 + c^2 = 4x^2 + 4y^2 = 1444 \\Rightarrow x^2 + y^2 = 361 $\n\nNow:\n\n- $ K = (x, \\sqrt{196 - x^2}) $\n- $ L = (\\sqrt{196 - y^2}, y) $\n\nThen $ KL^2 = (x - \\sqrt{196 - y^2})^2 + (\\sqrt{196 - x^2} - y)^2 = 196 $\n\nExpand:\n\n$$\n(x - \\sqrt{196 - y^2})^2 = x^2 - 2x\\sqrt{196 - y^2} + (196 - y^2)\n$$\n$$\n(\\sqrt{196 - x^2} - y)^2 = (196 - x^2) - 2y\\sqrt{196 - x^2} + y^2\n$$\n\nAdd:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 2x\\sqrt{196 - y^2} + 196 - y^2 + 196 - x^2 - 2y\\sqrt{196 - x^2} + y^2 = 196\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$\n(196 + 196) + (x^2 - x^2) + (-y^2 + y^2) - 2x\\sqrt{196 - y^2} - 2y\\sqrt{196 - x^2} = 196\n\\Rightarrow 392 - 2x\\sqrt{196 - y^2} - 2y\\sqrt{196 - x^2} = 196\n\\Rightarrow 196 = 2x\\sqrt{196 - y^2} + 2y\\sqrt{196 - x^2}\n\\Rightarrow 98 = x\\sqrt{196 - y^2} + y\\sqrt{196 - x^2}\n$$\n\nNow recall $ x^2 + y^2 = 361 $\n\nLet’s suppose $ x = y $. Then $ 2x^2 = 361 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 180.5 $, $ x = \\sqrt{180.5} \\approx 13.43 $\n\nThen $ \\sqrt{196 - y^2} = \\sqrt{196 - 180.5} = \\sqrt{15.5} \\approx 3.94 $\n\nThen $ x\\sqrt{196 - y^2} + y\\sqrt{196 - x^2} = 2x\\sqrt{15.5} \\approx 2 \\cdot 13.43 \\cdot 3.94 \\approx 105.8 $, too big.\n\nWe need it to be 98.\n\nTry to assume $ x = 14 $, then $ y^2 = 361 - 196 = 165 $, $ y = \\sqrt{165} \\approx 12.845 $\n\nThen $ \\sqrt{196 - y^2} = \\sqrt{196 - 165} = \\sqrt{31} \\approx 5.568 $\n\n$ \\sqrt{196 - x^2} = \\sqrt{196 - 196} = 0 $\n\nThen expression: $ x\\sqrt{196 - y^2} + y\\sqrt{196 - x^2} = 14 \\cdot \\sqrt{31} + \\sqrt{165} \\cdot 0 \\approx 14 \\cdot 5.568 \\approx 77.95 $, too small.\n\nTry $ x = 13 $, $ x^2 = 169 $, $ y^2 = 361 - 169 = 192 $, $ y = \\sqrt{192} = 8\\sqrt{3} \\approx 13.856 $\n\nThen $ \\sqrt{196 - y^2} = \\sqrt{196 - 192} = \\sqrt{4} = 2 $\n\n$ \\sqrt{196 - x^2} = \\sqrt{196 - 169} = \\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3} \\approx 5.196 $\n\nThen expression: $ x\\sqrt{196 - y^2} + y\\sqrt{196 - x^2} = 13 \\cdot 2 + \\sqrt{192} \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3} = 26 + 3\\sqrt{576} = 26 + 3 \\cdot 24 = 26 + 72 = 98 $\n\nWait! $ \\sqrt{192} \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3} = 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{192 \\cdot 3} = 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{576} = 3 \\cdot 24 = 72 $\n\nYes! So:\n\n$$\nx = 13, \\quad y = \\sqrt{192} = 8\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\nCheck: $ x^2 + y^2 = 169 + 192 = 361 $, good.\n\nSo $ b = 2x = 26 $, $ c = 2y = 16\\sqrt{3} $\n\nNow we can compute area of triangle $ ABC $:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB \\cdot AC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot b \\cdot c = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 26 \\cdot 16\\sqrt{3} = 13 \\cdot 16\\sqrt{3} = 208\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\nNow we need area of quadrilateral $ BKLC $\n\nWe can compute area of $ \\triangle ABC $ minus areas of $ \\triangle ABK $ and $ \\triangle ACL $\n\nBut $ K $ is such that $ AK = BK = 14 $, $ AB = 26 $\n\nSo $ \\triangle ABK $ has sides $ AK = 14 $, $ BK = 14 $, $ AB = 26 $\n\nSimilarly, $ \\triangle ACL $ has $ AL = 14 $, $ CL = 14 $, $ AC = c = 16\\sqrt{3} $\n\nLet’s compute area of $ \\triangle ABK $\n\nSides: $ AK = 14 $, $ BK = 14 $, $ AB = 26 $\n\nUse Heron’s formula:\n\nSemi-perimeter $ s = \\frac{14 + 14 + 26}{2} = 27 $\n\nArea $ = \\sqrt{27(27 - 14)(27 - 14)(27 - 26)} = \\sqrt{27 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 1} = 13\\sqrt{27} = 13 \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3} = 39\\sqrt{3} $\n\nSimilarly, $ \\triangle ACL $: $ AL = 14 $, $ CL = 14 $, $ AC = 16\\sqrt{3} $\n\nSemi-perimeter $ s = \\frac{14 + 14 + 16\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 14 + 8\\sqrt{3} $\n\nArea $ = \\sqrt{s(s - 14)(s - 14)(s - 16\\sqrt{3})} $\n\nBut this is messy.
