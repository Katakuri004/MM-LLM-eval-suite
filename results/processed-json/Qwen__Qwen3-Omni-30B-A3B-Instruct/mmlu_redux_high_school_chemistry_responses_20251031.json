Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nChoices:\nA) The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained.\nB) The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\nC) The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water.\nD) The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n\nAnswer:"
