        "The difference between speed and velocity is that speed is a scalar quantity, meaning it only has magnitude, while velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.\n\nSpeed is how fast an object is moving, regardless of its direction. For example, if a car is moving at 60 km/h, that is its speed.\n\nVelocity, on the other hand, includes the direction of motion. So, if the same car is moving at 60 km/h to the north, that is its velocity.\n\nIn summary:\n- Speed = distance traveled per unit of time (no direction)\n- Velocity = displacement per unit of time (includes direction)"
